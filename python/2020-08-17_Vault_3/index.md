# Vault 3

## Date: 2020-08-17

With this version of Vault, I wanted to find a way to display videos and gifs (anything that wasn't a static image).

I tried doing this with Qt, but I never got it to worked.

**This version of Vault was forked from improvements that another person made onto the original Vault program.**
