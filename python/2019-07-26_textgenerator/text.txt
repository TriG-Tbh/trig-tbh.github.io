I made this account just to post this cause they wont stop bugging me.Backstory: So my parents disowned me for being an Athiest (my family is very religious, they will lock at you like trash if you say you dont believe in a god). They kicked me out and didn't supported me thru college my last year of college, and I havent spoken to them for almost 3 years now. Just a few weeks ago I got word from my cousin that my little sister got hospitalized due to dengue so I went to visit her when she was about to be discharged. When I got there it was just my sister in the room. I asked where my parents were and she said that they were trying to raise funds for the hospital bill. Turns out my parents medical insurance didnt covered most of the hospital bill and left a large out of pocket (around 26,000 philipine pesos, if there are any filipinos out there you know is this a large amount already). Fortunately I was able to save up alot of the past year. So I went ahead and paid for it. When my parents came back I told them its already been paid for and that we're just waiting for the discharge orders. The first questions they ask is why was I there and where did I got the money from. I explained my our cousin told me what happened and that I was saving money for my little sister's college. They didnt even thanked me and the next question they asked is how much money I have saved. I didnt gave them the amount but they insisted I should give it to them since my sister is living with them. I told them no and that I will give it to my sister personally once she enters college (its her last year of high school). That wasnt good enough for them, they keep saying "they need the money" but wont even specify what the money would be for. I still didnt budge. A week pasted and they still dont stop bugging me, calling me ungreatful to them as my parent so on and so forth, even asking my girlfriend to have her talk to me about giving them the money.Edit: Okay.. Wow.. I really didnt thought this would get much attention I really just want to vent off some steam by sharing this. Thanks for the advices, reddit silver, gold and platinum
Bear with me here people, I'm on mobile.About a year ago, I was running a small video game tournament in the small company I owned. The wait list had a full list of 16 people, and it was fine until one person ruined it for all.EP: take a guess EK: yeaMe: lmaoSo we were starting up the games when a dad ran in to the store with his son.EP: were here for the tournamentMe: oh sorry, but the list is full. EP : well then, make some room.Me: I cant do tha-EP: listen, I can get you fired with the push of a button.Me: how?EP: I have been friends with the CEO of this company for a long time.Me: then call him.I watch him make a fake phone call then hang up.EP: he says your fired.Me: that's funny, considering I am the CEO.EP's look of shock still makes me laugh to this day.
Edited into paragraphs. Sorry for the initial text block guys. Note: I‘m German so this is translated. This also happened a month back and I‘m recalling the events. Long story, bear with me, you will be shaking your heads. I‘m a 21yo female babysitter and I have this girl (let’s call her Mia) whom I watch at least once a week plus whenever the parents ask me to help out. Mia is 8 now and I started babysitting her when she was four months, yes, I was 14 at the time. The family is great and Mia is a really really easy kid. We are like sisters. I never rose my rate so keep in mind that I have been working for 1,50€ (about $1.70) per hour for roughly eight years. And could expect a 20€ ($24) giftcard for both my birthday and Christmas. I‘m a babysitter for fun not for money and I‘m true to that. What I earn just about covers expenses, I have an actual job that’s paying for my life after all. When Mia is with me for an entire Saturday, we go on daytrips. She loves shopping and sightseeing so I mostly take her around to bigger cities. This is where this story starts. We are on the bus on an hour drive to the next bigger city. Taking the car meant stress for me as I don’t like driving and the train was more expensive. Though both would have been a 30/40mins ride, Mia and I like to go by bus. This private bus company has perks, on this particular day I paid 10€ ($12) for a return ticket, Mia being under 10yo went for free. Plus they wait for you on the way back (but causing delays results in fees).Anyway, we are on the bus and per usual, I brought my old Nintendo DSi for her to play with. I can do whatever, she plays happily, it’s a win. Until this entitled mom (EM) and her 10yo boy come along. They take the seats right behind ours. No problem, right? Wrong. It doesn’t take long for the boy to notice the console and the racing game Mia was somewhat fixed on.Boy to EM: Mom, I want to play!EM: Well, go ahead.I thought he would like get our attention and ask nicely. Nope. The boy jumps up from his seat, reaches over Mia‘s lean and tries to snatch the game from above. He gets hold of it for a moment but the hand strap stops him. I made sure Mia’s wrist was fine and the game not broken from the rough move then I turn around, stopping the boy from another attempt. Me: Young man, that wasn’t nice.EM: He just wants to play. Let him play, too.Me: Teach your child to ask properly and I will consider.EM: Don’t tell me how to parent, kid!Boy: Mom, I want that game!EM: In a minute, sweety.Me: No. It’s not yours and I‘m asking you to leave us alone. I sit back down, hoping to have heard the end of it. Way wrong. Mia‘s seat shakes a few times. The boy is kicking her seat. She asks him to stop, he continues. I warn the mom I would tell the drivers (there are always two on one bus, just in case).EM: He is bored. Give him the game and he will stop. I immediately get up, quickly help Mia change into another row then go to the front and explain the situation when I hear Mia yelling. Mia: Let go!I turn around, this boy has one hand on the game and the other pulling her hair. EM is smirking in satisfaction as the boy rips the hand sling off Mia and returns into his seat, holding the game. I immediately storm at him and grab it back without a word. He starts crying and screaming loudly. I don’t care. It’s 8am, this was supposed to be a happy girls day out. Now I had Mia in tears and a bratty son with his entitled mom on my hands. EM: You give that back right now! My son was playing it!Bus driver two comes to our rescue, practically pushed the woman and her son into the last row, asking us to take seats up front to separate us as far as possible. EM was advised to use some common sense that this was not her game and thus not hers to decide over. I didn’t quite listen any more but heard something from the lines ofEM: My son only wanted to try the game, these girls were unfairly rude to him! I demand an apology. I hide my hand and give her the finger. Not that EM could see. Mia snickers. Whoops. My bad. Mia saw. But Mia was already smiling and starting the game again. Fast forward to the end of a successful shopping spree. We were signed for the last bus back, 7pm departure, and ten minutes early. I let Mia choose the seats as per usual. Pretty much up front. There were two other couples waiting already and a third arriving with us. All seemed fine until the driver (I noticed it were the same drivers again) announced we couldn’t leave. Two people were missing but they would call them to either hurry to the bus or decline their seats. It would just be a few more minutes. Or not. We had to wait for them. Company policy. 7:35pm my nightmare comes true. EM and son walk up to the bus, not hurrying at all, ice cream cones in hand. No messy food on the bus. They have to finish outside. Again not hurrying in any way. 7:45pm. Headcount. We can finally drive back. Everyone on board is annoyed by the delay. EM and son probably took the seats in the other isle yet right behind us on purpose but I wasn’t going to say anything yet. Lesson learned, I hoped. Bus driver two was driving now. Driver one (DO) comes up to the mom. DO: M‘am, sorry to bother you, but you caused a 45 minutes delay and according to our terms and conditions, the company will fine you for that. EM: Fine me? What, for a few minutes? No way. I was told there would be a ride home waiting for us and that’s it. DO: I‘m sorry, but you knew that beforehand. It is in our ts&cs. EM: No one told me that.DO: You agreed to it, m‘am. The company will mail you everything, I need your ID please. EM: No. DO: I‘m afraid I will have to involve police then. He goes back into his seat. The boy shows up next to me. Boy: I want that game.Me: I told you no this morning. It’s still no. He pulls a sad face but goes back to his mom. It’s semi dark outside, Mia is lying spread over her seat and my lab. Not that I cared, she was tired and I expected her to fall asleep while playing. And she did, face buried in my jacket that she had folded like a pillow on my lab. I turn the game off but with the sling on Mia’s wrist, I can’t put it away. EM suddenly hovers above me. EM: She is done playing. Me: So?EM: My son can play now. Me: No, he can’t. It’s my game. EM: Come on, just give it to him. He wants it and you are too old for it anyway. Me: I don’t care, it’s my game. I said no so please leave me alone now. EM: What gives you the right?!She’s practically yelling. I‘m worried she might wake Mia and that I could end up with a cranky tired child. Me: I own it. Do me a favor and don‘t wake her.EM: She is asleep she doesn’t need the game now!Me: M‘am, the game is tied to her wrist, I would have to wake her to get it and in any way, I would be playing then. Not your son. It is my game and if I have to tell you again, I will ask the drivers for help. You know I‘ll do it. Driver one turns around to us, giving her a stern look. I figured he was listening. EM and son moved a few rows back. I thought she was defeated. Again I was wrong. A few minutes later, I was occupied with my phone, texting back and forth with a friend. I wasn’t paying attention to anything else but watching Mia didn’t fall off the seats whenever she moved. I didn’t think much of the tiny hand on my leg at first since Mia’s left arm was somewhere around there. Then Mia shoots up with an eardrum shattering scream. I nearly drop my phone in shock. There is the boy right between my legs. He had crawled up under our seats from behind to come up and probably try to snatch the game. That was his hand on my leg. And Mia had woken up to him staring right into her face mere centimeters away. The driver was cool enough not to cause an accident due to the scream but stopped the bus as soon as he could. Both drivers were furious. The boy was crying. EM is screaming at Mia and I for making him cry. All while I‘m unable to grasp the situation for a moment, holding the shaking 8yo. A man from the other couples gets up and manages to somehow silence the situation entirely.EM: This selfish girl scared my baby! She purposely screamed right into his face!DO: M‘am, why was your son underneath her seat?EM: I want this girl off the bus now!DT (driver two): M‘am please answer the question. Why wasn’t your son seated?EM: He is a good child, he can do whatever he want!Boy in tears: I want the game, mommy!EM towards me: You owe my child that game now, bi*ch!I ignored the insult. I had to calm Mia, trying not to explode in anger myself. I was so mad, I wanted to punch something. The boy tried to reach for the game again. I had had it with him. Admittedly, I didn’t want to push him away as hard as I did and I know I shouldn’t have pushed him back at all but since he only fell against his mother, I couldn’t have cared less. I got up, face bright red, taking deep breaths as to not completely losing it. Me: You listen here kid, don’t you dare to touch us or our game again! EM: You hurt my baby!Me: You better be glad he is underage, m‘am, otherwise he would be facing charges now. Multiple attempts to steal my game, for starters. And the way he crawled up beneath us, I could probably make a sexual assault out of that. Also, child protective services would be very interested to learn you even encouraged your son.Yes, I could have done that with him underage but let’s be honest, he was probably the victim of this woman’s miserable parental guidance. And I wasn’t going to ruin his life more though then and there I very much wanted to. EM: You have no right to talk to me like that! Your brat made my baby cry, you owe him that game now, he deserves it! He is a good kid!She wanted to get past me herself now. Behind me, Mia still had the game. I didn’t care for the game itself anymore but she would probably hurt Mia trying to take it.Now, I‘m 5'9" and roughly 70kg. I’m one straight noodle and I really don’t look like much. But I‘m the only girl on an all male rugby team. I take on guys bigger and older than her. And Mia knows that, she has seen me play. Mia: Do your trick!My trick. I can throw people over out of a stand pretty bad. That’s my standard move. But I couldn’t do that now. I had already overreacted pushing the boy. Both drivers and the man held the woman back. She was screaming and trashing around, throwing punches and insults all over while demanding I gave her son that game. The two other men came to help taming her. It took a while until she gave in and sat down. Finally, I thought once more, we could get home. I had already told Mia’s mom that we would be back late due to delay but nothing more since our departure. So I have Mia huddled over the seats again, shaking, but sunken into the game again and I take my phone out to let her mom now we would be even later. That’s when I hear EM whisper into her phone. She is obviously telling police some story about a stolen toy, child abuse, being threatened and cornered by several men and being too scared to ask for an early drop-off somewhere around. She was absolutely exaggerating and presenting her own twisted version of the story. I asked Mia to let me up and I go to tell the drivers. They looked mortified to say the least and contacted police and their office themselves as well. Now I had to type that out for Mia’s mom as short as possible, I didn’t want her to freak about police at the drop off since she was coming to pick us up. Fast forward 45 mins later. Eight cops are waiting for us, an ambulance, Mia’s mom who seemed to have introduced herself to police already along with some elderly man - who was there to pick up one of the couples. Mia is happy again, which I was overly thankful for. I was scared dead for this to have some traumatic impact on her. It could have been partly my fault for exploding. She had never really been in trouble hence had never seen me mad.Mia runs up to her mom, I follow with our shopping bag. EM and son are questioned separately in the ambulance, the rest of us has to answer questions as well. The drivers back us up with the bus surveillance cameras. EM is busted. Both she and her child are banned to ride with the company, she faces charged for a handful of things, encouraging her son to theft, false accusations and attacking me among them.At home, Mia proudly presented her new fabrics (I have a sewing machine which we work on on rainy days) and shirts. All within the shopping money her mom gave her for the day, I pay for myself.In the end I got off with a warning for pushing the boy, EM pressed charges that were dropped due to the circumstances. The judge figured I was protecting Mia and my property in a heated situation and that the boy‘s prior actions had made it necessary for me to step in. EM was fined for the entire delay she and her son had caused (1hr 18mins in total), was ordered to accept family assistance, and child protective services were to look over the family situation as well. Mia wasn’t effected in any way. Mia’s mother was quite understanding and doubled my Christmas giftcard. I guess it was somewhat an apology or a thanks, she said it was because I risked charges to protect her daughter and taught her to stand up and be strong.This weekend, we went on another trip. Boarding the bus heading out, I see a boy in line who looks oddly familiar but the man at his side doesn’t. I forget about it. We drive off. Mia smiles widely as I pull the DSi game from my handbag. Two minutes later: the boy. The f*ing boy!Boy: Give me that!Me, unsure if it really is him: How do you ask for things that aren’t yours, young man?Boy: I want that game. Now!Me: No, sorry. Too rude. Go mind your manners please. Boy: Daaaad! She won’t give it to me again!This bulky man gets up from his seat. To my luck, one of the drivers is driver two from the month before. He recognizes the boy and me. DT: Young man, I need to see your ID please. Where is your parent?Father: My son only asked to try the game, sir. DT: Yep. That’s why he got banned last month. You have to get off this bus or I will have to call the police. Father: I bought tickets for this! I have the right to drive!Police was called straight away. We stopped. The father got arrested for resisting police and fraud. Turns out both he and his son had signed in under fake names, also his son was 11yo by now and needed a ticket but was signed as 10yo and didn’t have one. Driver two came to me to apologize and see how we were doing. I told him no apology was necessary, I wasn’t sure about the boy myself first. I thanked him for resolving the situation immediately. There were a few more kids on the bus this time and Mia took over the last row with three other kids, sharing the game, taking turns. They had no trouble at all the entire ride through and I exchanged contacts with their parents. We are going to meet up in a funhouse next week. Friends were made. That’s how easy it can be. Honestly though, even on the second ride, had the boy asked nicely, I would have left the choice to Mia whether or not she wanted to share. After all, it could have been an opportunity to make a friend and people deserve second chances if you ask me. But no. They felt like he had the right to have my game because he simply wanted it. He was rude, the parents were worse. I have no bad feelings for getting them kicked off the bus. However I feel bad for the boy, it wasn’t exactly his fault if he didn’t know better. 
Hello again!I posted a story about my aunt ruining my sister's birthday day before yesterday. Turns out she or her daughter is on reddit and are subscribed to r/entitledparents and read the story. This is what happened last night-(EM- entitled mom who's my aunt, EC- her daughter, s- my sister)EM called my dad last night at about 11, when my dad was half asleep. EM- How could you do this to us? Aren't we family? Why did you shame us like this? It was so many years ago? Couldn't you just let it go?And my dad no idea what she's going on about so he asks her what has happened.To which she tells him that we posted on Reddit about my sister's birthday.My dad doesn't know and doesn't care what Reddit is and asks what's the big deal? EM- Wow so your daughters do things without telling you? You should keep an eye on them, don't let them get out of hand. You should have taught them manners. (my name) just exposed us and shamed us online. Dad- what are you saying? How did she expose you? She hasn't even talked to you in years. EM- she posted a story about us and as soon as EC read it we knew it was about us. (I haven't divulged any names in that story, not even mine.)Dad asks me if I did that and why. So it took a total of 15-20 mins to explain dad what reddit is and what I did. I tell him that I have just narrated a story  and haven't exposed  her identity in any way. So dad just hands me the phone so I can Explain it to her. As soon as I say hello EM starts screaming at me so loudly that it can be heard outside the phone. EM- you bitch how could you do that? Who do you think you are? You poison my child and then make it up as if I was overreacting? Take that post down now. And apologize for it on that sub reddit. If you don't I know gonna sue you.WTF I'm so angry that I just say no, I won't do anything of that sort. And that I would to see how you can sue me all the way from California.EM then proceeds to call me and my sister a whore and similar things.My dad takes away the Phone and asks her to not ever contact any of us again and blocks her. So hey there AUNT SHEILA hope y'all read this. EDIT- THE LINK TO PREVIOUS POSThttps://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/akpa3g/sisters_birthday_ruined_by_entitled_birthday_and/?utm_source=reddit-android
This encounter happened about 7 months ago. I do not want to insult your intelligence, because you most likely already know what EM and Me stands for, but I should say that EK in this story stands for embarrassed kid and OG stands for old gentleman (60-some year old guy). The kid was very polite and sorry, so this story isn't about him. Also, I'm translating this into english, so bear with me.A little backstory: About a year ago, I was diagnosed with a cancer of the nasal cavity (stage 2). The tumor was quite large, but thankfully benign (Edit: People have pointed out I formulated this wrong. By benign, I wanted to shorten the fact it still did not spread into other tissue, thus it was still 'contained', which is what I thought the word meant. I apologize for my gaps in knowledge.). To get it removed, I first had to undergo agressive chemotherapy to make it smaller. Thanks to the chemo, I had severe alopecia (hair loss), which made most of my hair and even eyebrows and eyelashes fall out. At some point I had to go bald, but I wore a wig, because I didn't want to look like a skinhead/neonazi (I'm 6'4" and pretty muscular, so I thought people would assume).So once, after a long chemo session in the hospital, I took the bus home. There's only 1 bus that goes from the hospital to where I live, so I took that one only to see it was absolutely packed. I felt like shit thanks to the chemo, so I asked a middle aged dude to let me sit. He was very understanding and gave me his spot without complaining (if you're reading this, thanks bro). 2 stops later, enter EM, a lovely whale with an "I demand a parley with the CEO" haircut and a 12-some year old kid. It took her roughly 5 seconds to see the bus was packed, start looking for a free seat, spot me and start marching (or, in her case, trying to fit in the aisle between the seats while shoving others aside) to me.When I saw her, I knew I was screwed. She then stood next to me and decided to talk to me. This is the conversation that followed:EM: Hey, could you let my kid sit down?Me: You mean me?EM: Who else?Me: Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm on my way from the hospital and-EM: (cutting me off) So are we (nonsense, the stop was a few kilometres away from the hospital), my boy just broke his leg and we're coming straight from the ER (her kid was standing next to her, without any suport, clearly embarrassed)Me: He's standing next to you completely fineEM: Look here, BOY (I am 21 YO), my kid DESERVES to sit downMe: Look madam, I'm sorry, but I just got back from a chemo session in the hospital and I need to sit down and rest (I then moved my wig a bit to let her see my bald head)-EM then straight up started yelling in my face-EM: STOP MAKING EXCUSES AND GET OFF THE F&#@ING  SEAT  YOU F@$&ING SKINHEAD PIECE OF S**T!!!-At this point, I was baffled. I didn't know what to say, the kid was trying to make his mother stop and we had the attention of the whole bus. She then grabbed me and tried to yank me from my seat. I held on tight and thankfully didn't fall off. Now, enter OG, my saviour.-OG: WILL YOU SHUT THE F&#K UP YOU DUMB COW?!?EM: WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE TALKING TO?!?OG: (with ice-cold voice) Stop assaulting other passengers or I will be forced to step in. Also, every dumb moron could see that the dude has cancer.EM: NO, HE'S JUST A F&@#ING SKINHEAD.OG: He's got NO EYEBROWS YOU TWAT!-Seems like that REALLY offended EM, because she spun around on the spot and threw a falcon punch in OG's face. I was shocked and in disbelief, the whole bus was flabbergasted and the kid probably wished he'd never been born. OG then said something unbelievable and a golden, sweet karma moment followed.-OG: Ok, that does it. Harassing passengers on the bus, physical assault aggainst a passenger and now assaulting an officer. You're in deep trouble lady. OG then pulled out a badge and told her to stay where she was. Then he pulled out his phone, called someone and told her she was being arrested. I couldn't believe it, OG was a bloody cop. At this point, EM was as white as a wall. The bus had just come to a stop, so she decided she'd make a run for it, but other passengers blocked her way (she then also got charged with resisting arrest thanks to this). 3 stops later, a police car was waiting for the EM and EK. EK told me he was sorry for his mother's behaviour and I felt really sorry for the kid (he wasn't a bad child, but his mother was a hellspawn). OG then talked to me and asked me if I wanted to press charges (to which I gladly said yes), took a statement, and thankfully was kind enough to let me solve everything on the phone, so I didn't have to come to the police station for questioning.In the end, EM got some jailtime (I think it was a few months) and some community service. I, in return, got a good story to tell and the sweet taste of instant karma.Right now, I'm riding the same bus home, as I just got back home from the hospital after a checkup, which reminded me of this. A friend, who's sitting next to me, told me I should post it here. He, as much as myself, also couldn't believe that such people exised, but it seems I proved it to him.I should also note that the surgery went well, I was declared cancer-free in november and my hair is slowly returning. Also, I don't need to wear a wig anymore.Edit1: Spelling errorsEdit2: Thank you, kind stranger, for my first ever silver!Edit3: Holy, thanks a million for the gold! Never had one before, now I'll need to learn, what it does.Edit4: Platinum... I can't even... my fellow redditor, you are a legend and I thank you from the bottom of my heart. I'd also like to thank everybody for their positive comments. You guys made my day and I'm sorry that I cannot respond to all of them. I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
So this is my second story. Little background im a Iraqi war vet and I believe in teaching the women and girls in my life to defend themselves with impunity. So at the very young age of 4 I have been teaching my child to defend herself. Story time:Im at work one day and I get this call from my daughters school. I go out side to answer the phone and the convo goes like this(Cast) Me: TerminatorP: principalP: Hello Terminator i need you to come pick up baby TerminatorMe: Can I ask what this is about?P: Yes your child has been in a fight and needs to leave the school premiseMe: What do you mean she's been in a fight? What happened? I mean she wouldnt just pick a fightP: Well from what we can tell EK was running up behind her and grabing her butt. She apparently warned him to stop and when he wouldnt knocked him out coldMe: So im confused what is happening to the boy then?P: Well your daughter seems to be the aggressor and we need her to leave and she is gonna be suspendedNow my child at the time lived with my ex-wife and i had heard from thr ex that my kid was having an issue with this boy for a while now and I knew my daughter had gone through many times telling on him to no resolve. I also knew that he had been told many times by teachers to stop and hadn't. Me: Wait so nothing is gonna happen to the boy who has been sexually assaulting my daughter for X amount of time?P: Well Mr. Terminator she did strike him once and knocked him out. She needs to learn violence is not the answer. She needed to bring it up to the attention of a teacher. Me: Ok so what I am hearing is your school is saying its ok the sexually assault a girl and that the girl in question needs to just be a victim of assault over and over again or be punished. Is that about the jist of it.Now i hear silence as the principal mulls over what I have just said. I can tell they are trying to justify this weak tea bullshit. I compose my self.Me: So heres whats gonna happen next. You can either punish both or punish nonr of them. Because i promise you the last thing you want is me in my dress A's and tv reporters showing up and blasting your whole school over this. Now I can understand that her punching this brat is unacceptable. But what I will not take and niether will she is him not being punished as well. Do i make my self clear.P: (silence)Me: Also why are you calling me and not her mother?P: Well Mr. Terminator she told us to call you. Me: You listen to me and listen good. I swear to you and God i will not put up with this. I demeand a meeting with you, her teacher and this boys family. If I cant make it my ex wife will. If this isn't resolved to my liking I will bring a holy hell upon this whole stick house youve built. Do you understand me?P: Yes sirMe: Good. Call my ex let her know the time and date. We will cordinate from thereI hang up and call my ex. She agrees with me and I go back to work. About a work week later there is a meeting but unfortunately I have work and my ex has to go in for me. From what I am told this boys family tries to play it off as "boys will be boys" and tries to get my daughter expelled. There are times when I remember why I married my ex and this is one of them. She proceeds to tell them that the last thing any of them want is me to get more involved than i already have and that if i have too i will bring it all burning down. Every brick. Out come was both were suspended for 4 days and the boy moved to a different class. And I never got a call like that again. Moral of the story my kids a bad ass and got a cake for sticking up for her self and a lot of love on both ends of me and my ex.Edit: Sorry for not being clear. She was 7 and a half at the time of the incident.Edit 2: For those who dont believe me thats fine. I have nothing to prove or answer for on reddit of all places. Believe me or not. Call me names or don't. I didn't write this for upvotes, gold, or silver. I wanted to brag about my kid doing what i thought was the right thing.
This is an exact C&P of a post I made yesterday that you all seemed to like but the mods removed (and then didn’t tell me why) so here you go :) (Apologies for spelling mistakes and grammar mistakes, English is not my first language :D) This is a pretty long one but I believe it’s worth it :PMe = the smexy beast writing this post EA = Entitled Aunt EK = Entitled Kid Mum = (I’ll leave you to figure that one out ;)) So a little bit of background first: EA and my mum used to get along good (well... as good as two sisters usually get on) but when EA had a kid almost all contact was dropped between them and she now only calls my mum to ask for “a small loan of (insert large amount of money here)” or other favours like her driving down to look after her EK for a day (she lives over 4 hours away) but “you can’t stay the night as I don’t have room” and gets offended when my mum declines. Anyway so as a sort of ‘olive branch’ (my mum got quite ill a few months prior and had one of those moments where she didn’t want any regrets when she died) my mum invited EA and her EK around for a few nights so they can catch up and whatnot.So I’m waiting at the door, the car pulls up out front and I open the door when she rings the bell. Me: *opens door* “Hey Aunty Mar-“Ea: “Hold this *shoves bag in my face which I take*” I kind of write this off since it WAS a 4 hour journey with a, most likely screaming, child. My mum and EA proceed to exchange pleasantries but I notice my mum is doing basically all the niceties (“how was your journey?” Etc. (Not really important to the story I just like to show that she’s not a nice lady)) Anyway so a few minutes go by, I make some Tea and a hot chocolate for EK (he didn’t ask for it, I was just being nice). EK: “it’s cold” It’s steaming at the top so I know he’s lying. Me: *laughs awkwardly and sits down* EK: *blinks at me* “it’s still cold” At this point I realise he’s not joking Me: “EK I can see the steam. It’s not cold.” EA: “oh he just watched ratatouille [for those of you who don’t know, ratatouille is an animated film about a chef rat] and is trying to be like *name of some character from the film*. Be a dear and remake one for him.” (Side note: from what I remember his character never says the food’s cold? But I could be wrong) I kind of sit still for a bit, not sure if she’s serious. EA: “now please! *laughs at EK who gleefully holds up his cup*” Now it should be noted at this point that my mum let it happen since she was desperate to get on with her sister. But that will change later don’t worry ;). Me: *knowing my mum wants this to work out* “sure whatever” I go into the kitchen and set down the mug out of view, rattle around with spoons and jugs and bring the same hot chocolate back. The kid is fine with it but EA? Oh no! EA: “you didn’t remake that! I just saw you put that on the side and bring it back out!” EK: *stops drinking* “MUMMYYYYY I WANT A HOT ONE!!” EA: “don’t worry hunny you’ll get a hot one” At this point I’m just annoyed, the kid was fine with it EA was just being a dick. Me: “well the microwave is in there *motions towards kitchen* knock yourself out” So I don’t cause a scene I leave the room and go upstairs to my room. Now recently I’ve started playing a new game on my PC called ‘Bioshock 2’ (for those of you who don’t know, it’s a horror game that takes place underwater) now a key point to both this story and the game is that in the game there are little girls who run around called “little sisters” and their job is to collect resources from dead bodies around the various game levels. Each one is protected by a huge man in a diving suit known as ‘big daddies’ which are usually referred to by the little sisters as ‘daddy’ or ‘mr bubbles’ (for whatever reason, idk xD) and in the second game you play as one of these big daddies and have to defend these little girls whilst they harvest the resources (if you’ve played the game or are super intelligent you probably know where this is going). Anyway so I boot up the game and begin playing, a few minutes pass and I assume EK gets bored because I hear him scampering upstairs and (without knocking) enters my room. Me: *knowing the game is quite gruesome and I shouldn’t play it in front of him, pauses the game* “hey! Could you please knock next time?” EK: “I don’t have to knock at home” Me: “you’re not at home” EK: *ignoring this* What’re you playing?” Me: “An adult game” EK: “but you’re not an adult!” Me: “aha you got me!” I don’t like him much but I get he’s a kid and, although he’s annoying as hell, I do recognise that I’ve got to bear with him a little bit since he’s only about 5-6 and doesn’t really know any better than to be annoying and squeaky. EK: “can you play some please?” Me: “not with you here mate, as I said, it’s an adult game” He storms out, slamming my door behind him. I was a bit confused since I, though annoyed, understood why I wasn’t allowed to play certain games when I was his age. A few moments pass and (this is where it gets a tad unbelievable so fair enough if you wanna call BS xD) in the game I set the little sister down and she begins harvesting the body and several enemies attack, attempting to get the little sister, just as I here footsteps coming up the stairs. I have a little eyerole as I know exactly what’s about to happen, it’s EA. She stands outside my door for a few seconds, I assume thinking of something to say, but I give it no thought. Just as she’s about to walk in (without knocking I might add) the little sister in the game gets attacked and lets out a high pitched “DADDY!” asking me (her guardian) for help. Now at the time I didn’t really think much of it as I know full well what I’m doing, whereas all EA knows at this point is that I’m a 16 year old boy and she knows full well what most 16 year old boys are... ‘motivated’... by. EA: *banging hand on door* “WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU!?” Me: “huh?” EA: *barges into room* [which if she thought I really WAS doing the thing guys do is pretty creepy] “WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU SHOW MY ANGEL?!” Me: *pauses game* “oh he asked to see the game and I said no since it’s an 18” EA: “DON’T LIE TO ME YOU LITTLE SHIT! HE JUST CAME DOWNSTAIRS CRYING BECAUSE YOU PLAYED AN ADAULT THING IN FRONT OF HIM!” Me: “what?? EA this is a game!” EA: “I JUST HEARD A WOMAN MOANING IN HERE! DON’T LIE TO ME!” Me: “what you HEARD was a character in the game. If you sit down I’ll show you!” At this point EK is at the door and wonders in EK: *points to pause screen* “that’s it!” Me: “I’ll play some of it for you to prove it’s not porn if you just sit down.” *gestures to bed* I’d like to point out that I wasn’t being aggressive at all during this. She was screaming at me and I was talking normally. Both of them take a seat on my bed. Me: “you might want to tell EK to leave, it’s a grown up game.” EA: *still angry but a little quieter* “if it’s good enough for you it’s good enough for him!” Me: *realising that didn’t actually make much says, plays the game anyway* BIG mistake. (Now I understand that I wasn’t smart in this situation and didn’t really think it through) I then proceeded to show her and her little brat about 2 minutes of me blowing enemies heads off with a shotgun and a huge drill (I did mention before it was gruesome). I paused, turned around and realised my mistake. EA looked mortified, however EK looked fine. EA: “WHAT KIND OF SICK PORN IS THAT!!?!?”I was surprised, surely she couldn’t be that stupid, I was expecting her to flip out because I showed it in front of her kid. But no. She still thought it was some kind of kink I had. Because why wouldn’t you *eye role*. Me: “EA, it’s clearly not porn!” EA: “I’M TELLING YOUR MOTHER RIGHT NOW! AND WE’RE TAKING YOUR XBOX RIGHT NOW AS COMPENSATION!” (I decided not to point out that it was a PC not an Xbox) EA points to my monitor and holds out her hand like she expects to be able to carry like that and that I’d just give it over. Me: “wtf. No way!” EK: “I want it mummyyyy!” EA: “you can have it sweety” *to me* “Give it NOW!” Me: “no! Get the fuck out of here crazy lady!” EA tries to grab the monitor and I smack her arm awayEA: “DID YOU JUST HIT MY CHILD YOU FAT SLOB!” Me: “FUCK OFF NOW!” EA storms downstairs, dragging EK by the wrist and I hear her yelling at my mum downstairs. Calling her a bitch and whatnot for letting me have a computer for “that filth”. I hear a thud and rush downstairs, worried. Luckily it was only her EK having a tantrum on the floor. I’m watching from the staircase and EA hasn’t noticed me yet. EA: “what kind of shitty parenting are you doing! I demand to having his Xbox and we’re sleeping in his room tonight!” Mum: “look can everyone please just calm dow-“ My aunt slaps my mum. This is where I lose my shit. Now I’m 6’1” and am taller than my aunt by about a foot I’m also not particularly muscly but am quite big and, when wearing the correct clothes, can look like I am. Me: *emerging from staircase* “Out. Now.” EA: *ignoring what I said* “and YOU! LISTEN HERE BUDD-“ Me: “OUT. NOW.” EA: “what?!” Me: “GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE NOW AND IF YOU COME BACK I’LL CALL THE POLICE!” At this point I’m about 2 feet away from her and she realises exactly how tall and (supposedly) muscly I am. (It’s also worth noting that I’d NEVER have touched her or her son in a violent way, but she didn’t know that.) EA: “You can’t do tha-!” Me: “I CAN! YOU AND YOUR LITTLE SHIT STAIN YOU CALL A SON GET OUT OF MY HOUSE RIGHT NOW OR I’LL MAKE YOU!” EA: “We’re family!” I was shocked at this. Like how can she even consider making that excuse when my mum was currently crying with a big red mark on her cheek.Me: “Get. Out. NOW!” EA, realising she’s beaten begins grabbing her things and tells EK to get his shoes on so she can tie them. Me: “Nope. Out.” *points to door* EA: “YES YES! I’M GETTING HIS SHOES ON YOU DICK!” Me: “PUT THEM ON IN THE CAR NOW FUCK OFF!” EA moves towards the door and I open it for her, she’s grabbing EK’s wrist and is practically dragging him along whilst he wails that he wants my game. I throw a bag she forgot onto the ground and slam the door behind me. I immediately check on my mum who’s sobbing quietly clutching her face, she was fine and I think it was mostly shock but she was understandably devastated. She spoke to me later that night and gave me a huge hug, thanking me. Needless to say we didn’t hear from EA for several months until she apologised a few weeks ago and proceeded to ask for money. My mum blocked her. Thanks for reading the whole thing (if you did), I’d love to say this story is fake but unfortunately it’s not and I really am related to that asshole. EDIT: since everyone was asking I’ll just put it here, my mum’s fine now. She was diagnosed with cancer and went through chemo so wasn’t ‘herself’ for a while. Normally she’d have hit her back but she was mostly upset not because the visit was a failure but more because of what the visit represented. She’s fine now :) 
I saw this today and I can't stop laughing I was traveling in my city metro. It wasn't that much crowded at that time, but all the seats were occupied. Still, you could freely stand without being humped by a stranger. There was this kid sitting in the reserved seats( the ones for people with handicaps, pregnant women and old people, definitely not for moms of 2 year olds). He was probably 14 or 15,idk. He is the hero of the story hereThen at one stop, our EM comes in. She has this cute little child who was trying to keep up with his mom's pace.  EM instantly sees our hero sitting at the reserved seat and just stares at him. I guess this was her way to make people automatically give away their seats or something. The kid didn't move though. This probably irked EM a lot I guess, cause she moved towards the kid with heavy steps. She comes near him, stop and again does the stare. The kid doesn't budge. Then she starts screaming. If she didn't have the whole compartments attention earlier she had it now. She starts berating the kid for sitting in a reserved seat and not giving it for someone more deserving like a mother like herself with a young kid (idk what her logic was. The seats aren't reserved for them anyways). She just keeps shouting and screaming and tries to get others opinion on it and for a while people were on her side. Then the kid, out of nowhere, rolls right side of his jeans up and detaches the artificial leg and keeps it infront of EM. The look on her face was priceless. It looked like she was mortified and embarrassed at the same time. She just backed away silently. And just got off on the next stop. I don't think that was her stop.
I used to work in a small chain of Bookstores/Stationery shops. We’d sell books, pens, paper and so on. It was a quirky little store, straight out of a romantic love novella (or a Stephen King book, if you prefer).This happened a few years ago and I reconstruct it from my memory. While trying to be as accurate as possible I can’t guarantee it.The cast of this play:EM: Entitled MotherLG: ~~a South Korean~~ ~~multinational~~ ~~conglomerate~~ ~~corporation~~ little girlMe: ~~a virtue example of a working class hero~~ just meND: Nice dad (of little girl)The Story:EM walks into the store with LG. It’s rather early in the morning. EM looks around, asks me if I could watch her child.Me: “Oh no, I’m terrible with children, sorry”EM tells me that its not for that long and I shouldn’t be such a fuss about it. I still politely refuse. Its not my job to watch children, I’m afraid to do something wrong. What happens? EM leaves the store, who do I find hidden in the corner? LG who seems to be rather shy/fearful.This happened back in a time before everyone had smartphones. The kid obviously didn’t had a mobile on it, I suspected the mother also wouldn’t. Wasn’t to surprised that LG didn’t knew the number of their landline. I sigh. What are you gonna do? If something happens to that kid while being in the store and you being the only present employee you’re gonna have a bad time.Me: “Hey girl, what’s your name?”LG: “(her name)”Me: “I’m (my name and surname)”LG, happy like only kids can be if they think they did something smart or they knew something: “My surname is (surname).”Now this rang a bell. I had a good customer with the same surname. It turns out that its her dad. I didn’t get paid enough to babysit. In fact I didn’t even got paid enough to do my normal work. I call her dad at his workplace since we saved that number in our system. The call went along those lines:Me: “Hi ND, here’s Me from bookstore XY”ND: “Oh hi (me), how’s it going? I don’t remember having any open orders.”Me: “Yeah, erm, look, listen, do you have a daughter?”ND, confused: “Yes why do you ask?”Me: “What’s her name?” (I just wanted to ensure its really her dad and not just a stupid coincidence. If I think now about it, LG told me its her dad, so I don’t know why I wasn’t sure)ND apologizes for EMs behavior and tells me he’s gonna pick LG up as soon as possible.While waiting for ND I picked up one of our sale-books (box with damaged books that we try to sell with huge discount before throwing away), a picture book from Disney. LG tries to read a little, I read a little.ND arrives, LG runs to him and hugs him, crying that mommy was mean to her. ND soothes her and thanks me for babysitting her. He gives me a bottle of wine and buys something small from the store.ND: “If EM shows up again, could you not tell her that I picked up LG?”Me: “What. Why?”ND: “If you don’t feel like it you don’t need to. Its rather complicated and you already did so much for us”ND leaves. In the evening EM shows up. Just to point out – she dropped LG at about 09:00. It was 17:45.EM: “Where’s my daughter?”Me, already chugged about half the bottle of wine and thus a little boozed: “Your WHAT?”EM: “My daughter. I dropped her in this store and you where here.”Me, way to drunk for work (but already decided to go for another job or homeless, both would have been better): “YOUR WHAT?”EM was on the edge. Thus I did what I thought was the smartest thing to do:Me: “A guy came into the store and picked her up. He seemed nice. Gave me some wine for her”At this point I expected her to explode/attack me, but she just left the store.A few weeks pass and ND and LG come to the store. Both happy to see me. ND asks me If I got a few minutes. An excuse not to work? Obviously I took the time for…customer service. Gave LG the same book we’ve read the last time and had a talk with ND.EM and ND where in the middle of a divorce when EM dropped LG at our store. One of the reasons ND wanted a divorce was that EM “wasn’t nice” to LG. Now in my country as a male it’s rather hard to get custody for your child. No matter what. LG wanted to be with ND but that doesn’t matters. EM dropping LG in our store was a gift of the heavens. ND took LG to his sister over night, EM pretended that LG was sleeping at one of her friends. ND wanted to call them just to ensure that LG is fine. EM didn’t wanted that. LG friend didn’t knew where LG is. EM claimed she dropped LG at LGs friend. ND faked panic and involved the police. EM insisted that LGs friend kidnapped LG. Police asked ND and EM separately and ND told the police what happened. EM still insisted on her dropping LG at LGs friend. ND had proof of it being otherwise since he already called the police when he dropped LG at his sisters house.Now in court ND apparently said something like “EM can have all she want, even my wine collection. I just want to be with my daughter.” EM, knowing that ND didn’t had any money left and had some quite expensive wines agreed. Daughter ended up with ND, mother paying alimony. What EM didn’t knew: ND was replacing his wine collection before the divorce with the cheapest wines he could find at different discounters, gifting away the expensive ones. He knew that EM either is gonna take everything from him or will break his wine collection.We both laugh, I gifted the book to LG who seemed very happy. When EM dropped her she was shy, seemed small and now she had such a big smile on her face and was curious for everything. She could read much better than a few weeks ago. She seemed like a bird taking of to fly towards the sun.&#x200B;I absolutely hated my job. But situations like these make me a little bit nostalgic. Somehow I miss direct interactions with customers. On the other hand  I don't. I obviously don't.
Long ago, way back in the before-time, I worked for one of those bulk warehouse club stores. My trade was simple: I was a wrangler of the silver buffalo, and dutifully retrieve the ol' ghetto strollers I did.The job in-and-of itself wasn't the worst I'd ever had; I got plenty of exercise, got to be outside and generally didn't have to interact with the 'members' (calling them customers was taboo) for the most part.For the *most part*.The thing about this job is that the company I worked for had a- reputation- for being cheap. Thusly, more often than not, I was on my own out in the parking lot."Big whoop," you might say. "You gathered carts? You should see how hard MY job is!"Yeah, well... Shut up. This is *my* story, butt-munch.I digress. The reason that being alone sucked is that this store didn't have just one kind of cart. Hell, they didn't even just have TWO kinds of carts. You had your classic garden variety cart, the kiddie-cart with the plastic facade to make it resemble a car, the electric scooters (which weren't supposed to leave the store, but did so with alarming frequency), and finally, the bulky, hard-to-control flatbeds. On top of that, whenever someone needed help loading their haul into their minivans, I was the guy they called. You know, because the greeters, cashiers, and managers were all *busy*.As you might expect, one man cannot be in multiple places at once, and as a result,  on some of our busier days it became incredibly difficult to keep enough carts in the vestibule.Our story begins on one of these days...So there I was, chugging along like a good worker drone, struggling to keep up with the sheer volume of people coming in to buy cheap bulk goods. Sure enough, I get a call on the radio:Manager - "[*sktchh*] Top_Gorilla17..? We need you to help some members load their purchases. [*sktchh*]"Me -"Uh, I'd love to, but I'm barely able to keep up out here as is..."Manager - "[*sktchh*] Just do it, Top_Gorilla17. You can afford to stop gathering carts for two minutes. [*sktchh*]"Ron Howard - "*He couldn't.*"I didn't want to push my luck, so I complied. After spending 20 minutes loading people's purchases because when one person needs it, suddenly they ALL need it, I came back to find my vestibule a near-ghost town, save for a single line of carts that was half-gone, and... The *Karen*.I won't waste time describing this specimen. She was the prototype. You know what she looked like.There she stood, menacing, tapping her foot with such speed that could make any metal drummer green with envy... You could collect the contempt in her gaze in a jar.Karen - "Where are the big flat ones?"I blanked for a moment.Me - "I'm sorry?"Karen - "Ugh. *Mexicans*..."For the record, I'm very much white.Karen - "WHERE. ARE. THE. FLAT ONES."Me - "Oh, you mean the flatbeds. I'm sorry, I was just helping some other members load their merchanise and haven't had a chance to-"Karen - "OH MY GOD, I don't care about your excuses, you have ONE JOB, and a TRAINED. MONKEY. Could do it!"I just want this lady out of my face, so I don't fight it.Me - "Sorry ma'am. I'll grab one from the parking lot for you..."Karen - "You'd *better*..."So I go back out to the lot and find a whole line of flatbeds sticking out of a corral blocking several parking spaces. I push them all into the vestibule where she waits, huffing about how I'm wasting her valuable time. I separate one from the rest and bring it to her.Me - "I'm terribly sorry about the wait, ma'am."She leers at me with utter malice.Karen - "Hmmph. Unbelievable..."And with that, she dismisses herself into the store, where she will be someone else's problem. I shake my head and return to doing what I'm paid to do.About fifteen minutes later, I'm returning a line of carts when I see her pushing her flatbed to her Miata and jawwing about 'stupid people' (most certainly referring to me) on her cell phone. You know what she had bought? What she had insisted on having a flatbed for?A *cake.*This wasn't even like, a *big* cake. It was one of those little circular numbers, like [this](https://ajugglingmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Mickey-and-Minnie-Party-08.jpg).Anyways, I witness as she continues to yammer on about how I nearly ruined- *RUINED* I TELL YOU- her precious baby's birthday party, when the most glorious thing happened: Still clutching her phone with those jai-alai scoop claws of hers, she attempts to pick up the cake with one hand, the plastic topper pops off, and she spills the cake *all over* her undoubtedly expensive designer outfit.Seething with white-hot rage, she locks eyes with me. Karen - "**YOU! GET ME ANOTHER CAKE! NOW!**"Me - "Terribly sorry ma'am. I've got one job, and these carts won't gather themselves."I walked away, shit-eating grin plastered on my face as her shrieks faded into the distance behind me. I've had my share of nasty customer interactions before, but *this one*...(•_•)( •_•)>⌐■-■(⌐■_■)*Really took the cake.*#YEEEEEEAAAAAAAA^AAAAAA^^AAAAAAA^^^AAAAAAAAA^^^^AAAAAAAAAHEdit: After posting this, a handful of you fine folks suggested that I should write a book. Well, I *did*! PM for the link if you're interested.
EDIT:Not sure if anyone will see this hah but thank you so much to everyone who left a supportive comment or message. I just posted this to vent and I didn’t expect any response at all. To those that are curious, I have worked through my trauma (which sadly extends beyond my father) and I am in a great place atm. I’ve had therapy, but I’ve also had many wonderful men in my life who modeled what great fathers, partners, and friends actually look like, since I couldn’t learn that at home. For this I am eternally grateful.ORIGINAL:I almost burst out laughing when he said that.For years, he’d come into my bedroom before I slept and molest me. For years, I held the secret because I feared I would not be believed. And then I found out I was right in my fear.All I have to say to him is this;You want grandkids? Well, that’s not happening. As long as I live, you will never know your grandchildren. I will put them first and be a better parent than you have ever been. I will surround them with a better family than I had, one that will listen to and believe them no matter the cost because that is what family does.You want to be a grandpa? You won’t, no matter how long you beg on your knees. You threw me away long ago and it’s too late now.
Buckle up everyone for this bumpy rideOkay so I was chilling in my living room around 3am playing some video games. My parents are out of town visiting some friends and I decided to stay home, house to myself and all. So here I am, in nothing but bra and panties, when there's a knock on the door. "wtf?" I think to myself, so I scramble to get my clothes on and I answer the door. It was a family acquaintance with her already whiny little brat. She's also visibly pregnant, and we'll get to why that part is important laterMe: hey name what's going on?Her: my car broke down and tow company can't come get my car until tomorrow, think me and brat's name can crash here tonight?Me: Sure you guys can sleep in the living room I let them inMe: want anything to eat or drink?Her: Coffee if it's not any trouble?Me: sure no problemSo I go to make some coffee when I see little shit picking up my controllerMe: hey little guy please put that downHer: oh can't he play a game?Me: No I'm in the middle of something plus he wouldn't know how to play the type of gameHer: but he reeeealy wants to, don't you little shit?Little shit: I WANT TO PLAY!!!!Me: No, you can't playLittle shit: I WANT TO PLAY I WANT TO PLAY I WANT TO PLAAAAAAAAAAAAAY AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH throws the fucking controller at the tv shattering the screenMe: WHAT THE FUCK?

Edit:Platinum! Many thanks kind stranger!Silver too! <3&#x200B;Good Morning Reddit, just allow me a few disclaimers before I start.\-First have in mind that this story takes place in the north of Spain (Asturias) therefore I will try to give the necessary context so the cultural barrier is as little as possible.\-Second that this is my first post in this community.\-Third I'm Spanish so please forgive me for any orthografical (edit: it's orthographic /facepalm) or gramatical mistakes (However, feel free to point them out to me if you want)\-This got longer that I expected, I'm missing an XXXL tag :)&#x200B;Now let's get started! First of all i will give out some **context**, so feel free to skipthis and go directly to the story.This took place a couple of years ago, when I was 17 and I used to spend part of my summers helping in my grandpa's restaurant. The restaurant was located in the bottom floor of our family house in a little village (30 inhabitants) and my great-grandparents (The parents of my mom's mom) lived in the upper floor. In the restaurant my great-grandmother and my grandma were in charge of cooking and my great-grandpartent and grandad were in charge of attending the tables. It was kinda small as it had like 8 tables of four on the inside and we could set another two outside if the weather was good. As the restaurant also served as a bar it was filled with locals and as many of them were retired they used to spend the whole day playing cards and drinking beer/wine, so although it was a small location in summer usually was full of people. Also please have in mind that my great-grandparents founded this restaurant in the year 1941 therefore it was well known and had a good reputation among the locals. I'm also proud to say that my great-grandparents were very loved in their community as they really were great people.Although it was a quite remote place, in summer we used to get like 4 or 5 groups of tourists per week and the rule was that my brother and I were in charge of serving their tables as we were the only ones who knew any other language than Spanish.Our opening hours at the time were from 12:00 to 22:30 but the kitchen was only opened from 13:00 to 15:00 and from 19:30 to 21:00. We only served one menu, composed by a starter, two main dishes, dessert and cider or water (10€)&#x200B;So now the **story**. For convenience I will use the following abreviations:Em: Entitled Mother EF: Entitled Father SK: Spoiled Kid (7 years old)  GGP: Great-Grandparent M: Me&#x200B;It was arround 16:00 therefore most of the customers had finished eating and were chatting over a cup of coffe or some liquor, my grandparents and great-grandparents were still eating as they waited until everyone was finished. Therefore my brother and I were in charge of serving the tables just in case anyone wanted something else to drink.&#x200B;Suddenly we hear a car outside and I can hear a woman loudly speaking in English, as soon as they enter this happens:EM: We would like to have a table, X from the Y Hotel told us this was a great place to eat.M: I'm sorry ma'am but the kitchen is already closed as it's kinda late.EM: Yes it's late because we got lost in this dammned roads! Is it so difficult to put proper signals? Also we have a little kid that is hungry.M: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, let me check If I can do something for you. (I then went inside and explained the situation to my grandma who told me to attend them as everything was already prepared and it would be just heating the food)EM: Well are you going to give us a table or not? If the kitchen is closed how is it that those people are eating (pointing at my grandpas)? (at the moment I thought she was behaving like that because she was kinda hungry and I wasn't really used to dealing with rude people, as the majority of tourists used to be really respectful)M: Well those are the owners, so they can eat whenever they want. (I said this while laughing a bit) Anyway I have just asked them and you will be able to eat too, so please follow me to your table.&#x200B;They follow me to the table and I explain to them that there is only one menu, they give me a strange look but they seem ok with that. I serve them the bread and I put a bottle of water on the table, they start devouring the bread so my "They were a bit rude cause they were hungry" theory seemed to be confirmed.&#x200B;As soon as I bring the starter EF demands to have the Wi-Fi password.EF: Hey, we have seen that there is a Wi-Fi network, which is the password?M: Yes, there is one. However the Wi-Fi is for the staff personal use. (We had a measured and reeeeally slow connection that had like 5Gb of data which my grandpa used for checking some newspapers and my brother and I used for sending whatsapps to our friends.)EF: That's bullshit! We are paying customers and we deserve to have access to your Wi-Fi!EM: Yes, our little angel wants to watch some videos. We don't have any kind of internet access here!M: Sorry but as I have said it's for personal use.EM: That's not right, this would be unnaceptable in AmericaM: Well, I'm sorry to inform you that we are not in AmericaThe EM tells something to the SK and then he starts running arround the restaurant stomping his feet and shoutingMy Great Grandparent comes to me and ask me what is happening, I explain the whole situation to him and he ask me to please translate what he is going to say.GG: Please lady control your child, or I will have to ask you three to leave.EM: DON'T YOU DARE TELL ME HOW TO RAISE MY CHILD YOU DINOSAUR!EF: DON'T GET CLOSE TO MY CHILD YOU OLD CREEP!By this point everyone is of course looking with disbelief to these morons.I doubt for a sec but translate all of this to GG expecting a not really nice reaction.Instead of saying anything he slowly turns arround and ask two men who are sitting on a table to take the whole family out of his restaurant.I proceed to explain to the family that if they don't get out, those two men who also happened to be two Guardias Civiles (like rural police forces) would be taking them out.They don't seem to believe that those two men were policemen and they refused to leave until we served them.Finally both men stood up, showed their plaques and asked them (in their best English) to leave.EM EF and SK finally stand up and leave, however as they were leaving the policemen realised that they had parked in front of our garage blocking it (in a zone signaled as a no parking zone) so they decided to ask for their rental car papers while taking a couple of photos and giving them a 200€ fine for blocking a private property garage.&#x200B;Okay, this ended up being far longer than I expected. On my behalf I have to say that I have family in the USA and that all Americans I have met in the USA are really nice people so please don't take this as an american-bashing post.&#x200B;I hope you all have a good day!
I'm allergic to fish/seafood. It's not the anaphylactic type of allergy, thank goodness, so I'm not going to die if I eat some but I do throw up, have a stomach ache and a massive headache for a few hours. Enough fish/seafood and I break out in small red hives over my arms.My mother didn't believe it and as a child, I couldn't stand up to her properly. She'd force me to eat stuff with seafood or fish in it to prove I wasn't allergic, then ignore me as I was sick.One day, she held a dinner party.  I was dressed up beautifully and trotted out to parade before the guests. At the time, I was around about 9, precocious for my age and absolutely fed up with my mother making me sick. When she held out a fish cutlet (fish cooked with vegetables, rolled into a ball, covered in batter and fried) for me to eat, I saw my chance.Me, loudly: "I can't eat that, I'm allergic to fish."Mother: "No, you're not. Eat it."Me: "I am allergic! I'll throw up!"No Asian mother will back down in front of guests for fear of looking like she can't discipline her child. My mother grabbed the fish cutlet, shoved it to my mouth and said in her most firm voice of command, "EAT."So I ate it.Cut to about ten minutes later.  I go up to my mother and tug on her sari to get attention.Me: "I don't feel well-- " BARF.I vomited on her, on the expensive carpet and in full view of all the guests. My mother has a reputation for being a kind, generous, charitable and very religious woman so in front of all the guests, she couldn't do anything except act sympathetic and send me off to bed to recover.She never made me eat fish or seafood again.&#x200B;
EDIT: Omg thank you guys so much for the support, I was really not expecting this post to blow up like it did, but shit happens. Luv you all, and shout out to u/Boodooper for the silver, much love.So for some context. I'm a 17 year old male and I work at a Segway tour company. It's actually really fun, I get to ride Segways around the city and talk to people, and get paid to do it! (Plus the tipping isn't bad). So anyway, there was a tour booked a couple of days ago and I came in about 20 minutes early to answer emails and get everything ready. The group shows up, mother and daughter, and that's when things get interesting. I'm not going to insult your intelligence by telling you what EP, and ME stand for, but D = daughter and FBI = Federal Bureau of Investigation (just for some useful info).EP and D come in and I check them in.ME: Alright I have some waivers for you to sign. D, how old are you? D: Uh, 16.ME: Ok, then you don't need to sign a waiver.I ask this because if kids are younger than 18, their parents sign the waivers for them, but EP only heard me say the first part, not when I said D didn't need to sign a waiver, so she thought I was just asking her daughter how old she was. This was probably what started it all.We go on the tour, and while I'm giving my spiel, EP keeps interrupting me to tell me stuff about D and find if we are compatible.ME: ...and so this non-profit organization opened in-EP: Are you in college?ME: Haha no, I'm a junior in high school.I'm usually pretty free with info about myself on tours because it helps keep people relaxed and initiates conversations during lulls in the tour. Plus it helps with tipping ;)EP: Oh, D is also a junior, she is an artist.Stuff like this keeps happening throughout the tour, and everytime, D gets redder and redder. My mom does this too where she just tells random mall attendants about me, so I know what D is going through and I feel her pain. At the end of the tour, I tell the two of then that they have 15 minutes to go around the town and then they can meet me back at the Segway place. I get back and start getting things set up for their return. They roll in (pardon the pun) and I take their Segways to start charging them.EP: So what do you think of my daughter?ME: Pardon me, what?EP: I saw you checking her out during the tour, are you gonna ask her out?D: Mom, stop!ME: Um, ma'am I just recently got out of a relationship and I'm really not lookin for anything right now.EP: What!?!?ME: Huh?EP: Is my daughter not good enough for you!?ME: No, that's not it, I just said that I just got out of a relation-EP: You are going to date my daughter and that's final!ME: You can't tell me what to do! I'm not your kid, and if I don't want to date your daughter I don't have to! Besides, you haven't even asked her if she wants to date me!D: Yeah, I don't want to date him.ME: SEE?!?EP: I'm going to call your boss and tell him about your terrible customer service! You're never going to work in [city name] again!ME: (pulling out my phone) Alright, you want to call him and explain this situation? How you're trying to force me to date your daughter and get me fired for saying no?Then I guess the absurdity of the situation finally sunk in, and her face transitioned from pure rage to slight confusion. EP: Wait, maybe I don't want to-ME: No, let's call him. (Start to go through my contacts, and press my bosses name). Lets have this conversation.EP: I don't think that's a good idea-(Phone starts ringing)EP: D, let's go! EP runs out the door, D turns to me and says "I'm sorry," and then follows her mom.I hang up the phone before my boss answers and start cleaning the Segways.  I have some more stories from my work, y'all tell me if you wanna hear more.
Some backstory: I'm in a DnD group with a couple of friends from nearby, and one of the members of the group was a kid who was about 15 years old. He's a really sweet kid, likes helping other people out, and he's a BIG fan of Dungeons and Dragons. He also has cancer in both of his lungs. He's from a religious family that basically forces him to act pure while he's in their sight. The mom is WBC-level rabid, while the dad is just a sensible person who just tries to get him to be a good kid. When he's out of sight of his parents, he just does normal teen stuff. Because of his mom, the only books he was allowed to own were christian books and bibles. He joined our group mainly as a way to escape his home life and his mom. A couple of weeks ago, the cancer in his lungs started to get to him, so he was taken to a hospital by his parents. He contacted me about this a day after he was taken to the hospital, stating that he wanted a Monster Manual as his last wish, stating that he was tired of reading the same things. I bought him the book from Barnes and Noble, but considering that he's a dying teen I got him Volo's Guide to Monsters and Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes stacked on top of that.The next day, which was his birthday, he was still in the hospital, so I brought him the books as a gift. After he blew out the candles, we had cake and he started opening gifts. Mine was the first to be opened. Seeing what they were, he immediately got this humongous grin on his face and hugged me. Meanwhile, his mom stared down at the books with a look of pure disgust, with her husband staring at her with this wary look in his eyes. She picks up one of the books and relights one of the candles and HOLDS THE DAMN BOOK over it to try and set it on fire. I manage to stop her and demand "What the FUCK are you doing?! He asked me to get those books and I'm not going to let you take them away!". His mom simply stared me down and said something along the lines of the books being 'sinful', 'satanic', and full of evil and that her son had no business with them. I retort and say that her son can read what he wants and that she shouldn't have to force him to be christian. She starts getting red in the face and yelling at me about essentially forcing children to believe in God from a young age. I state that I'm a baptist (which I actually am) and say that faith in God is a matter between God and the individual. She turns red all over and actively starts to try and destroy the books, with me, my friend, and her husband trying to stop her. At one point, I shouted "WOULD GOD WANT YOU TO DO THIS? TO RESTRICT YOUR DYING SON'S FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION?!" right in her face.This just sets her *fucking ablaze.*She tosses the books aside and starts trying to STRANGLE her son, and her husband calls security immediately when she does this. Security get here within about a minute of the two of us trying to pry EM off of her son and drag her away, with her shouting that we're all 'catamites to the devil'. Both her husband and my friend charge her with child abuse, assault, and attempted murder. Trial's still going, and I'll try to update this post as the trial goes on.Edit: Holy SHIT I came back to 300 karma and this with 3K upvotes. Thank you so much for your support!Edit 2: Whoever just gave me Gold, thank you so much!Edit 3: Thank you guys for the silver!Edit 4: Trial was almost a disaster. Me, him, and her husband all prosecuted against her. The moment she saw us she tried to tackle us shouting something about divine retribution, but the officers restrained her. During the whole thing, she kept pinning the blame on me and him, calling us corrupted by sin. Needless to say, she was pronounced guilty of all three charges that I mentioned earlier. The moment she heard this, she went apeshit and tried to attack the judge, but officers tased her to the floor. Now she'll be serving for 20 years for the other three charges, with ten more on top of assaulting a court official. Thank you all for the support you guys gave us!Edit 5: To all who are wondering, my friend's fine. The cancer is gone from his lungs.
I posted part of this in r/amitheasshole as a recent conflict I will bring up later left me doubting myself but due to so many peoples interest I've decided to elaborate my family’s boundless entitlement here. I am currently in custody of my two little sisters (Amy who is 17 and Liza who is 8 - not their real names for obvious reasons - I am a 29 male and we live in Australia – I am Potato as that’s what Liza calls me) and this is basically the story of how my family felt they were entitled to both of my sisters’ bodies and I wouldn't stand for that. I would like to warn anyone who has faced abuse in the past as parts of their story may trigger some people, and to anyone who has faced abuse in the past, I do feel deeply sorry for you. The main part of the story takes place about a year ago. I'd moved out 6 years ago at the time and moved to another state for work and study. I was honestly really slack with keeping contact with my family which is probably why this went on so long. When I do think back to the time before I moved out, I didn't treat Amy the best and if I hadn't moved out and had so little contact with my family, I may have turned out just as entitled and as much of a horrible person. I came back to visit for a grandparent’s birthday, after spending so long away I spent the morning catching up with aunts, uncles, cousins, my parents of course and Liza. Now this was actually the first time I’d really realised the oddities of my family. Perhaps it was the change in environment, a few of my roommates had little sisters and whatnot after all, but it was the first time I’d noticed how quiet the little girls of my family were, I guess I’d always just thought of Amy as shy and quiet but my little cousins were so much the same, polite, shy, quiet and obedient. Though at the time I brushed this off.  After a few hours, I realised that Amy was nowhere to be seen all day. The party was at my parents’ house so this confused me, and I slipped inside to see if she was cooped up in her room like a lot of 16yo would be, talking to friends or doing assessments. What I found is a memory that will haunt me forever. My oldest uncle on my father’s side, laying over my sister who was quite clearly in a lot of pain and struggling not to cry as he pinned her beneath him. I completely lost it as any brother would, shouting at him to get off her and out of her room. I scared the hell out of both of them but in that moment, I was honestly ready to kill my uncle. Amy was pretty messed up in the head when I tried consoling her. She was covered in scares, had a rash that I later found out was an allergic reaction (she was allergic to strawberries) she didn't speak and looked at me as if she expected for me to hurt her too. Her room was dimly lit, the blinds taped closed to her wall, all the things she’d had when I left were gone, leaving her bedroom feeling cold and empty and to add insult to injury, she was a months pregnant. When I demanded an explanation from my parents, they (paraphrasing) said that it was my uncles right and my father simply pointed out one of my 11yo cousins sitting quietly with her parents and told me to have fun. I stormed off back to Amy's room, quietly packed her a bag of necessities and managed to sneak her out of the house and into my car before doing the same with Liza. Part of my wanted to get all my cousins out too, but my main focus was of Amy right now who sat trembling in the back of my car. I drove them both to the closest police station to report what was happening. I'll skip most the details of the legal battle that ensued but my family did not take kindly to being outed for what they were doing, it was a tradition that spanned generations and ‘there shouldn’t be anything wrong with tradition’. Amy and Liza were put into temporary foster care, Amy was wreck. To her, everyone could and would hurt her and I got reports every few hours that she was having a panic attack. Three of my uncles went to jail for a very long time, I got a fair bit of money out of a range of family members, full custody of both Amy and Liza (no enforced visitation to their parents), my parents had to pay for any therapy costs, medication and medical needs for both of them. My family was torn in two by this, many of my aunts leaving their husbands with their children after finally having the courage too follow me, uncles who had married into the family took their wives (who had also been abused) and cut off ties. I still keep in contact with these members of my family and I’m grateful for their support and glad that my cousins are safer now. Even some of the older guys who had been brought up thinking it was okay to treat women that way took themselves into counselling once they realised just how messed up it was and I’ve had more then one instance where they admitted to hurting Amy and apologised which I’ve accepted as these cousins did their best to take their siblings or other cousins out of harmful environments. Now I do believe some part of the ruling protected the younger men of the family provided they see some form of mental health professional as they grew up thinking that this was all normal so they didn’t end up in jail but did end up on some list of possible sex offenders, not entirely sure there. No one is sure who fathered Amy’s child but she had her pregnancy terminated as we were told her physical and mental health would not cope with carrying a baby she ultimately would unlikely care for. She did consent at the time and it was brought up by her psychologist once she was doing better and she confirmed that she would have no love for the baby due to the circumstances which she fell pregnant. For 6 years, Amy had been physically, xually, mentally and emotionally abused in every way conceivable. This mostly came from my father’s four brothers and brother in law who married into the family, my parents both stood by and let this happen, offering no support for Amy. During the case my uncles argued it was their birthright being born into their family and it was simply 'Amy's rite of passage' before she was married off to one of my uncles’ mates at 18. They used her allergy as a form of torture and manipulation, wanting her to be silent and obedient they would press strawberries against her skin any time she said a word and force her to eat them when she stepped too far out of line. A lot of my aunts from my fathers side admitted to enduring this treatment to, although most of them were lucky and didn’t have allergies to exploit.  I honestly can't even begin to explain everything that was wrong with Amy because of their behaviour. Liza, for the most part, was okay. She needed a little therapy as she was being groomed into compliance and taught that what she would experience was normal, but Amy had completely shut down, it took two months before I could even get her speaking. She trusts me now and we often sit down, and I let her talk and open up about whatever she feels comfortable too. Her stories often have me struggling to hold back tears while I comfort her. I did get Amy a service dog a few months ago, tailored towards the emotional support she needs on a regular bases. Lickity Split honestly is the goodest of good doggo's. She knows exactly when she's needed and is a massive help when it comes to calming Amy's anxiety, especially in public. We've had more than one encounter with unrelated entitled parents thinking they or their kid deserves her dog more than her (let me know if you want these stories published too because I’ve seen people like to read about service dog related incidents) but anyone who does think that can honestly fight me, no one deserves her dog more than her. On one occasion one of my aunts, her husband went to jail, tried taking Lickity Split because 'their money paid for her'. I told her if she ever comes near my property again, I would call the police as there was a restraining order against her towards both my sisters. Later she came back and tried to poison Lickity Split with tainted meat but one of my lovely neighbours caught her and chased her off. Police were called, she is now in jail too after having to pay a fine and some money to me because at this point, I’m pretty well acquainted in the legal system and sued her. My family still tried to get my sisters out of my care, reporting me for everything from animal abuse to drug trafficking (they planted drugs in an identical stuffed toy to Amy’s comfort toy a left it in the yard, but Amy would never do that so I knew something was up immediately – home security systems work wonders). I’ve actually become pretty chummy with the local police officers who have to inspect their claims, but they know I’d never do anything to endanger my custody over the girls, they mean the world to me.  I will admit though, I have done things to hurt me bond with them, yelling when stressed and throwing things from time to time but I’m not perfect and Amy has told me that although these moments do scare her, she doesn’t feel endangered being near me when they happen (I also spoil them a little when they do happen). Now the reason this ended on aita is because a few weeks ago my mother contacted me saying she wanted to talk. I was hesitant, but agreed and we met up in the next town over (no way I could be followed home) my mother explained how she was in the process of divorcing my father and she wanted to have a relationship with me and my sisters, with emphasis on mending her bond with Amy who had not called her mum in years. She explained how she was pressured into the marriage after she gotten pregnant with me and never wanted that life for her daughters. I flat out told her no (something several members of my family disagreed with) as she could have done literally anything to support Amy emotionally with what was happen – done anything to make her feel better or more secure with what was happening to her but instead she was shunned and isolated except for when she was needed to cook, clean or provide some sort of service to the family, even going as far as to berate her whenever she did try to confide in my mum that she was in pain or scared. Amy was well past her breaking point when I took her and had even planned on killing herself less than a week after my visit. My mother argued that she had the same right as the other members of my family who had left and had contact with my sisters but I told her it was because they were doing it to protect their children and themselves, they didn’t wait a year after losing custody to try and fight for them and I really don’t even need to give a reason, I have custody and she does not. Members of aita convinced me that when Amy is in a better place mentally and Liza is older, I bring it up with them, leave the decision in their hands. I’ve been told Amy will be a dependent well after she turns 18, her mind just doesn’t function properly so there is no risk of her mother getting into contact behind my back even when she’s an adult and while Amy does have a phone and a computer, she doesn’t have any social media as she doesn’t what any chance of her family trying to contact her as they’ve threatened her with many forms of torture in the past. This story doesn’t have a slam dunk ending, I have my sisters and they’re in a safe environment where they’ll get to grow up as kids. Amy is getting the help she needs and is slowly making her way out of tower she built to protect herself in the only way she could, but she knows there isn’t a rush to come out – I’ll work with her at the pace she sets. She’s still discovering her own interests but quite like just reading a book with a form of fruity tea. She also has a small collection of stuffed animals (mostly build-a-bear) that she adores and takes one with her everywhere – she sensitive to texture so the feeling is a comfort for her – and once a week we sit down to try to find older bears she likes (we only have three build-a-bears on her wish list) and honestly, I’ve loved helping Amy discover herself, she lost a lot of her ability to think and feel for herself during this time and watching her find her favourite book genre or her favourite types of music is a great feeling, knowing how far she’s come and I live for the days she actually manages a smile.  I’d be willing to answer most question so if you want to know anything, just ask as I want to bring awareness that these things are still happening to other kids but obviously somethings I’d rather keep to myself for the girls sake. TL;DR – entitled family feel they have a right to do what they want with my little sister bodies, after I get custody, mother believes she still has a right to see them. Edit: First off, thanks for the awards, it means a lot, and thank you for everyone offering your kind words and support. It's honestly really difficult this past year and at times I really do struggle but have to stay strong having my two little girls depend on me so much and the support every has shown is truly the best. Some extra notes: Amy was pulled out of school at 10, a few months after I left home. She was kept isolated in her room and had very little meaningful contact. Also, I'm not going to share a photo of Lickity Split as she is a very recognisable dog and not everyone who has contact with Amy and her dog know the full story so I'd rather not draw and links between this story and her real day to day life as she struggles with it enough. Edit 2: Wow this blew up over night... Thank you for all the awards and sorry if I don't get back to some people. Also, I'm meeting back up with my mother later to date to talk to her about the possibility of seeing the girls in the future, once Amy is a lot more stable and Liza is old enough to understand what I saved her from and the decision will be entirely theirs.Edit 3: Answering the commonly asked questions to save myself repeating. Yes I was groomed to but much differently. I was taught I could treat the woman in my family how I wanted but I was never really a violent person and sexually driven, I was a jerk and although I have anger issues at time, taking it out on other people is not something I ever saw effective. My focuses were more on my studying. Some of the other men in my family were the same and were never really abusive. Unfortunately it never really clicked in my head that if I was being taught that, what were they teaching my sisters behind my back? I blame myself fulling because of how long Amy suffered and do my best to make amends for it by showing her love no one else cared to do. I am in therapy too, I work closely with my Amy's therapist too so don't worry about my mental well being. I'm looking after me too. And for those mentioning BS because I didn't go into detail about all the legal detail, I would go days on just a few hours of sleep during the whole legal battle because I would be looking into every detail I could to know how to help my sisters. Most of it is a messy blurr. I also didn't feel many people would care to listen and I had to chop loads out of my story and still had people saying it was too long. The story is unbelievable, I get that, I wouldn't want to believe it either. You don't need to say it though, just down vote and move a long, I don't care what you choose to believe. Amy was pulled out under the premise that she was being homeschooled. I'm not sure how it worked from there. I was never home schooled and I didn't home school the girls. I'm not sure how my family got around DOCs or anything like that, I just know it worked for 6 years.Update: I've just posted my first EM doggo stories for those who were interested.Update 2: Posted the second EP doggo story.
(Mobile) So back in high school one of my closest friends got pregnant and gave birth to the sweetest baby boy. She stopped going to school for a while to take care of her kid but still did online school so she could graduate with her class. One thing we would do is go to one of the local food places near the high school on Fridays and today we decided to go to this nice Chinese place that I frequent regularly and the little old asian lady knows me by name. This Chinese place has a sticker on the front door that says something like "breastfeeding will always be allowed" which is great since that's what my friend is more comfortable doing for her baby. After we ordered our food and hung out in this little waiting area when the baby gets all fussy. She takes out the little cover and covers her baby and her chest as she starts to feed him. We keep talking until this woman and her son who had to be around 10 comes in. I recognize the kid as one of the kids I looked after when I use to volunteer at a youth center. He comes up to me and starts talking to me and then asks my friend what shes doing with the baby. Before my friend could answer the boys mother cuts in. "A disgusting thing is what shes doing. Dont you know better than to do that in public? And why are you even doing that if you're only a kid." My friend has an attitude sometimes so I try to jump in before she would start to throw things. "Its not illegal. And mrs. L is fine with it. She has a sticker on the door." Mrs. L being the little old asian lady by the counter who was just oogling the baby a second ago. She smiles at us and continues to write some stuff down. The mother wasnt happy about this and continues with her BS. "I'm sorry but I'm just not ok with a baby breastfeeding another baby. Can you please just stop." She says in frustration. Mrs. L finally cuts in and in her broken english she says "nursing baby is a beautiful thing. You have problem, you leave." She then taps the order on the window that leads to the kitchen and apologizes to my friend for the womans nasty behavior. She then looks at the boy who is still next to me and says jokingly. "You're mother, she dummy right?" This makes the boy laugh and the mother just grumble in her seat trying to stay as far from us as she could. When my friend finished and we grabbed our food mrs. L threw in an extra order of eggs rolled since they where my friends favorite. Everything was fine until Monday came and I saw the boy again. He pulls me off to the side and tells me that his mom said she doesnt like me or my friend. I just ask him if he still likes me and he says yes. Yay
So I teach 8th grade, and a few months ago I had a female student come up to me in private and tell me that a male student in her class was sexually harassing her. She shows me text messages that he has sent her detailing highly graphic sexual things be wants to do to her, and tells me some of the things he's said to her when they are in the halls  She tells me that she has asked him to stop repeatedly and but he is still doing it, and she wants me to help keep him away from her in my class.So before I file a report to have guidance and admin investigate the issue I spend a class period keeping a close eye on the two of them to see if I can confirm or deny anything she's saying. Once I'm looking for it, I observe the male student doing things like licking his lips at her from the other side of the room, hovering around her, and finding reasons to walk past her desk. I personally overhear him make a sexual comment about her to another student. Based on what I've seen, I go ahead with referring the boy to admin for sexual harassment and  make contact with parents of both students to inform them that the issue will be investigated by the school and possible disciplinary action will be taken.I don't make direct contact with the boy's mother but i leave her a voicemail and ask that she call me back.The next day I'm in my planning period and I get a call from the office saying there's a parent there for a meeting.Now, our policy is that parent meetings must be scheduled in advance and logged with the office. I don't have any meetings scheduled today, but I have time so I decide to go and see what's up.It turns out to be the male student's mother in the office. She very nicely asks if we can talk face to face about what's going on, and for some dumb reason I agree, even though usually we like to have another teacher or staff member present for meetings.So we go in a conference room and I go over the allegations (avoiding names). I tell her that a female student has accused her son of sexual harassment and I saw enough evidence in class to refer it to the office for investigation. EM: Now what exactly did you hear? Because I know my son- he would never harass a girl. He might say something stupid that got taken the wrong way, but that's just not who he is. So what exactly did you hear him say? I want to know what this girl is saying about him. Me: I saw him licking his lips at her and overheard him say to another boy that he wanted to 'ride that ass all night'.EM: what do you mean licking his lips? He gets chapped lips, he might not be doing it to harass some girl. She can't just say things about him and try to ruin his life- I know my son and he is not that kind of person, no matter what some girl says.Me: Well, admin and guidance are going to investigate and based on what they find they'll be in touch with you.EM: So wait what did you tell them? You can't just go and say '(boy's name) is harassing girls' based on what one person says. He's already been suspended twice, and now you're going to get him expelled just because some girl wants to get him in trouble for no reason?Now I'm thinking ugh why did I do this. Mom is getting worked up, I have no one else there and my next class starts soon. I repeat that I just reported the things the girl said and the things I saw, and that it'll be investigated. I reiterate that I'm not the one making any final decision and if she has an issue she needs to talk to the principal.EM: Well (Principal) hates (son's name). She's not going to listen. You need to go and tell them that this is all nonsense. You saw him licking his lips because they were chapped, I'm not going to have all this 'harassment' bullshit. Me: Again, if you have an issue I'm not the one to talk to. I just reported what I saw. They'll look into it.EM: But you didn't see anything and you need to tell them that. I'm telling you- I know my son, and you've got this all wrong. If he gets in expelled because you don't know what you saw its going to be your fault.I eventually talk her down enough to get her to leave.I report to admin that parent is hostile about the accusations and go about my day. They end up investigating and finding hard evidence that he was actually sexually harassing 3 different girls. Boy got expelled. 
Now, for a bit of context, last weekend was liberation day in Holland, and many cities were having festivals to celebrate. Most of these festivals have free entrance, so they tend to crack down on people bringing their own food and drinks, to increase profits from beverage sales. Mate of mine lives within the area where the festival is taking place though, so usually we drop our booze at his place and retrieve it during the festival. Since it didn't seem like a terrific idea to walk around with a bottle of JD, I mixed it into a 1L Coca Cola Vanilla bottle with just enough coke that it looked like coke and went onto the festival grounds.I'm assuming everybody is familiar with the common abbreviations; JD is my good friend Jack Daniels. We've been through a lot together.While walking around with the bottle of 'coke', I feel a tap on my shoulder. Festival etiquette is to move over to the side to let somebody pass, after which I move along. I suddenly feel a hand grabbing my shoulder and trying to pull me back, so I turn around, and I'm faced with a typical Karen.**EM;** Where'd you get that? *pointing at the bottle***Me;** Brought it from home.**EM;** Can my kid have some?**Me, not wanting everybody to know I had booze on me;** They sell coke over there, you can buy your kid a fresh, cold one.**EM;** They don't sell vanilla coke there, and he doesn't like the regular one. He wants yours. *holds out hand***Me;** If he doesn't like the regular one, I'm pretty sure he won't like this any better...Meanwhile, the kid has started squealing about how he's thirsty and 'wants THAT one', and EM starts giving me a demanding stare.**Me;** ...Okay lady, I'm going to be honest with you. Half of this bottle is whiskey, and I don't think it's a good idea to give the kid whisky.**EM;** You're lying! You just made that up so you wouldn't have to share with my baby! Now give it to me!While I kinda shrug and turn away in attempt to disappear into the crowd, the kid grabs the bottle with both hands, wrenches it from my hand, and makes a run for it, his mom in tow. I follow them, and I find them just in time to see the kid take a few massive swigs from the bottle, after which he starts violently throwing up almost immediately. Figuring the best move for me would be to not further pursue the now vomit-covered bottle of Jack and coke, I decide to head over to my mates and mix a new one. In passing, I throw EM a 'Told you', and make my way into the crowds. Within seconds, EM charges me, and starts attempting to take a swing at me; YOU POISONED MY BABY!!! SECURITY!!!We're separated by bystanders, and a stall holder gets security (S), which questions both me and EM.**EM;** He gave my baby this bottle of poison and told him it was coke! I want him arrested!**S;** Sir, what's in this bottle?**Me;** A premixed whisky and coke, somewhat on the generous side with the whisky.**S;** And why did you give that to a kid?**Me;** I didn't, sir. I was mostly planning on getting smashed myself, to be fair. They thought it was coke, wouldn't believe me when I told them it was booze, and snatched the bottle from me. What you're seeing here is just the result of the kid taking a drink before I was able to stop him.At this point, a bystander chimes in, confirming that he saw the kid snatch the bottle from my hand, although he hadn't heard the conversation. Security tells the mom to not pull that shit again, to take her still crying kid to the first aid post, and instructs me to be more careful with the next batch I'm 'inevitably about to make'.Edit; formatting.
Note: 1. I'm on mobile. 2. Not native English.Thanks for the 3 silver and gold!FAQ: -I'm the father (as in male). -We had potatoes with peas and carrots with sausage for dinner. (Yes, I'm a male that knows how to cook) -the bike will never be left unattended outside. -Yes, I have a sturdy lock. -I located and took a picture of the serial number.Backstory:I'm a single parent, I have a beautiful girl that's turning 5 in August. The past year I have been fighting with ex that tried to keep my kid away from me. Lawyers aren't cheap, and being single doesn't exactly help with my finances. Couple of months ago I won the lawsuit and I finally got to have my kid at my home again. For the past few weeks she was saying she wanted a bicycle, but still recovering from the lawsuit bills I wasn't able to afford it.Past week I got my summer bonus which finally gave me the financial boost I needed. So yesterday I finally was able to buy my little girl her bike she wanted so badly. I enjoyed my time with her riding our bikes, but then it was getting time for dinner, which I still had to make. So we head back home and park the bikes in the back yard. We go inside and I start making dinner.After about 10 minutes I spot movement in the corner of my eye through the kitchen window, that's on the side of the house. I see this kid (guessing 6 or 7 years old) just casually strolling by with the brand new bike I just got today. My heart dropped, and I run to the front door hoping I'd catch him before he rides away. I was lucky I did. I yanked the bike out of his hands, and freaked out to him saying it was mine and he had no right to just walk into other people's back yard to take things. I was pissed. I force him to get tf off my property, and set the bike inside my front halfway, thinking it's over. Boy, was I wrong.After comforting my little girl that never saw me this mad (poor thing) I return to the kitchen to continue making dinner. Fifteen minutes later, doorbell rings. It's the kid and his Evil Mother.EM: you give my boy this bike back! He found it! It's his!Me: he "found" it in MY back yard! I got it for my MY kid today! You should try teaching your damn kid some manners, he shouldn't trespass on other people's property to take their things. EM: don't tell my how raise my kid! Give me the bike back or I'm calling the police! Me: (laughs) call the damn police! And I slam the door in her face.By this point my 4 year old is crying her eyes out, and I get to comfort her again, as she's thinking she's losing her brand new bike. Her sobbing finally over, I try continuing to make dinner, yet again. Preparations done, I'm about to put is all on the stove, doorbell. I flip out, storm to the door, violently open it getting ready to just explode into the bitch's face. Guess what, she actually called the cops. I instantly calm down when I see it's the police and invite one of the 2 officers inside while the other stays with the evil woman. I explain the situation, and show him the box the bike came in, along with the receipt that has my name on it. He shrugs and apologised for the inconvenience, assured me I won't be bothered again. I let him out and close the door with a smug smile on my face. I check the front window to see what's happening, and I see her go into full tantrum. It ends with her into handcuffs and on the backseat of the patrol car.Bye felicia!Don't know what happened to her, and I don't care. I finally finished dinner, and my kid still has her bike. That's all that matters to me.Boy, what a day.
The players are: OP (me), EM (entitled mom), Mrs. T (my teacher) and Mrs. A (another teacher)I've been student teaching this spring in a 6th grade class. It's been a stressful semester, but a good one. Since day 1, I have been treated 100% like a colleague and equal by my teacher and her grade level partners. I'm very baby-faced and don't always look like I'm in my 20s. But I know these kids very well (I subbed for them a lot last year and in this past fall). So they already have respect for me and we have a decent relationship.This week we're on a camping trip with 4 total classes. I finished student teaching, but my teacher invited me on as a teacher to get the experience. We mostly hang in the medical lodge and make sure kids take their meds each day. Easy gig after months of teaching. The kids are happy to see me.Anyways. We arrived at camp. I rode on the bus with my teacher. Two of the other teachers drove their cars with student luggage, and so did some parents. I got off the bus and started to head down to the lodge with the other teachers for our meeting with the camp director and the counselors.I stopped off to fill my water bottle before heading down. As I finished up, a mom came up to me. I smiled and was about to greet her--"You can't wear that.""Excuse me?""Young lady, that is so inappropriate for a school setting. You're going to distract my son and all the other boys. I'm going to have to ask you to change as soon as we get to our cabins."For reference: I was wearing jeans, a black undershirt, and a tank top with thick straps that covered my bra. You literally only saw my black undershirt that kept my bra from being seen through my shirt.Oh, and it was 100 degrees (Fahrenheit).I let out a small chuckle. I thought it was a silly mix up we could laugh about later. Nope, that set her off."Don't you dare laugh! I'm serious. Who is your teacher? You are so disrespectful. No wonder you're dressed like that, trying to get the boys' attention I bet."I put on my best "polite teacher dealing with parents" smile. "Whose parent are you?" She told me. Her kid was a trouble maker from another class. "Mrs. EM, I don't know if you're aware of this, but I'm not a student. I'm a teacher. And the camp's dress code allows my students to wear tank tops, so do not ask them to change.""Now you're lying to me?! Where is your teacher? I'm getting you sent home!"One of my teacher's partners, Mrs. A, overheard the yelling and came over- also in a tank top."Is there a something you need Ms. OP?"I shook my head. "No, I was just introducing myself to Mrs. EM. She didn't know Mrs. T had a student teacher this year."Mrs. A nodded earnestly. "Ms. OP has been such an asset to all of us this semester. Your son actually got a few science lessons from her this year! She's going to be a great teacher."EM was absolutely red in the face.Later that afternoon, we brought all the parents down to our air-conditioned lodge to talk them through the week ahead. Mrs. T, who is kind of our grade's team captain, introduced me to the parents. Everyone except EM was happy to meet me, and a few even said their kids loved having me as one of their teachers.The best part of the week so far was when her son ran up to me at dinner and asked in front of his mom, "Ms. OP, can you teach 7th grade next year so you can be one of my teachers? I'm gonna miss you!"*Edit: Thank you all for the kindness! I love teaching and am excited to make this my career. EM's son is something of a trouble maker, but he and I got on really well. Also, obligatory thanks for the gold!*
This is my first story here (please be gentle)Also, this story is more about the kid than the parent, but the parent was supporting the behavior so...&#x200B;Our cast: EK: obvious. EM: obvious. Me: super obvious. Neighbors 1 and 2: 2 neighborhood kids(note that the neighbors are actually pretty cool, the EK was just older than them and so had some authority).&#x200B;And so it begins&#x200B;One summer day last year, (I had just turned 14), I was playing some basketball with these two kids from my neighborhood in their driveway, they're family is pretty rich, so they have a fully paved "driveway" big enough to be a sizable court.It's just me and them for about half an hour, until satan's son himself came over from down the street, this kid is the really stereotypical little shit who made the select soccer team 3 years ago and still thinks that he runs the place.&#x200B;So we let him join the game and everything is fine for a bit. I'm a little bit on the *ahem* "bigger side" but I'm really strong, so I play really well as a Center, posting up and that. And the EK is guarding me and he's getting worked. He's shorter and not as strong so he's getting dominated.&#x200B;Here's the major incident.&#x200B;I've just grabbed a loose ball and I'm running back towards the basket, the other kid gets back before me and stops my drive, so I start to back him down again. He must have just been really frustrated by him not getting a chance on defense so he thinks up a plan. At this point I was wearing a hoodie and the fucker grabs my hood from behind and pulls as hard as he can&#x200B;I, not expecting my airflow to be cut off, especially while I'm breathing hard, start to panic. I can't shake him off of my back. I don't know how long he's hanging on, but It felt like a whole 45 seconds, that may not seem like that long, but I'm freaking the fuck out, so it feels like forever.&#x200B;An eternity later, his grip loosens and I finally get him off, I'm fuckin fired up so I punch him right in the nose, definitely not as hard as I could, but it certainly would have hurt a lot. This little shit, however, he drops like he's out cold, meanwhile I'm on my knees trying to get my breath back. He's bawling his eyes out, he's rolling and screaming and all that, being the melodramatic turd that he is, but his mom is running over, and it was that moment where I knew I was fucked&#x200B;Now, sometime between when he started and when I socked him, his mother came out, but she's the typical "I want to speak to the manager" white upper-middle class mom who volunteers to be the head of the PTA every year and goes to starbucks 20 times a day, and the EK is very much her son&#x200B;EM: OH MY GOD (redacted) ARE YOU OK, WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIMMe: He just nearly choked me out so I punched himEM: WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT, YOU'RE SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HIM!!!!Me: But he was chocking me out!EM: Come on dude, you've got to be more mature about this!Me: What do you expect me to do?, apologize to HIM for making him choke me?&#x200B;This whole thing goes on for a while until the neighbors step in to try to protect me&#x200B;N1: OP really didn't do anything wrongN2: Yeah, he didn't even hit him that hardEM: But OP shouldn't be hitting people in the first place. Especially not my son (yes, she actually said especially not my son)N2: But it was basically a trade off, he...EM: Why are you guys trying to protect him, you should probably go inside, you don't know what you're talking about&#x200B;They keep trying to help me out, but to no availThis just goes around for another 5 minutes before EK finally gets up and LIMPS, yes, LIMPS back to his houseI go home cuz I'm sick of this shit and I'm tired.&#x200B;The next day, I try go back over, but the EK is there already, neither of his parents cars are there so I assume that he's staying at the neighbor kids' house until they come back, I decide to go back inside because I don't want to interact with him.&#x200B;A couple hours later, EK shows up at our door with his mom standing at gate of our fence.EK: Um, Hi OP, I was just coming over to say sorry for choking you yesterday, I won't ever do it againMe: Uhhh, Ok, thanks, I'm sorry that I punched youAt this point, my mom comes to see who I'm talking to and she asks what's going onEM pipes up and says...EM: We are here for your forgiveness giftMe: My what?EM: Your forgiveness gift, it's a tradition in our family that the person who apologizes last has to give the other person something to make up for itMy Mom: Excuse me? What's going on?&#x200B;I explain what happened and as I explain what happened, she seems to get more and more disgusted by the situation&#x200B;I finish explaining and turn back to EK who had tried to "correct" my story while I was explaining it to my mom, saying things like, "He punched me twice in the face, and then kicked me in the nuts while I was crying on the ground" My mom is basically a bomb sniffing dog for lies, so I can see from her face that she knows that's bullshit.&#x200B;I turn back to EK&#x200B;My mom: I'm sorry but we don't do forgiveness gifts in this familyEM: We do in this one, EK, pick something out,&#x200B;EK looked around and saw my PS4, and he points at itEK: Mommy, I want that(Keep in mind that this kid is just about a year younger than I am, too old for mommy, too old for this whole situation in my opinion)EM walks up to our door and sees it's my PS4EM: Great, We'll take that as our gift&#x200B;My mom, with steam billowing out of her ears, slams the door in their faces and quickly locks it. They start pounding on the door so hard that it sounds like they are trying to break it down. We leave the door, but they stay there pounding on the door for at least another 5 minutes before finally leaving&#x200B;I still leave my neighbor's house anytime I see him walking down the block&#x200B;That's the story, I understand that It was super long may not be as high stakes or entertaining as some of the other stories here, but thanks for reading if you got this far&#x200B;Edit: Holy shit, I never expected this kind of story to blow up, thank you so much guys&#x200B;Edit 2: IDK who you are but thank you for silver, I had no idea that this would get so popular so thanks to everyone again&#x200B;Last Edit (I promise): SWEET FUCK BOYS, GOLD AND PLAT, NO WAY!!!!!!! Thank you all so much for this, this is really kind of amazing!!
On mobile so if things go wonky, my attorney is accepting calls. After never dealing with an EP in my life, I've now had two in the span of a few months. Normally a foul mouth, but I'll keep things clean for r/slash and others >:). So I am a delivery driver for (major food delivery company) in (major college town in Texas where everyone loves maroon). Normally, it's not bad, pays pretty well, and customers are generally fine, though you'll always have idiots in every service job. This, however, surpassed anything I'd ever experienced before. I get an order alert on my phone, relatively simple but expensive order (we drivers love expensive orders) from a restaurant nearby. In the portion for delivery instructions, the customer explains that I need to call her once I arrive, as ringing the doorbell (as I normally do) would disturb her autistic son. Okay, no problem at all. I received therapy for sensory issues when I was a kid, so I'm going to be even more sympathetic to that than the average person. I receive the order, and drive over to the house (nice part of town), and give the customer a call. Younger woman answers, tells me to come up to the door. I do so, and enter the EM, who, strangely, was fairly attractive and did not have the typical Karen haircut. EM = Enraged Marmalade, Me = The Muffin Man, NSL = Nice Support LadyMe: Here's your order ma'am, is there anything else I can help you with today? EM: Yes. My son is autistic, and people like you don't understand how difficult it is to raise him. I shouldn't have to pay this much for food. Can you give me a discount? Me, baffled: I'm sorry ma'am, but the app calculates your order total, not me. It's already been paid for. The EM did not like that answer. Her face changed from a smug smirk into a snarl. I suppose I didn't realize how ridiculous the idea that people pay for their own food is. EM: Well why don't you pay for it then? I'm not sure if you heard, but my son is autistic, and it's your fault that he's still hungry! Me: I'm sorry ma'am, but that goes against our policy. If I paid for you order, I'd probably be fired. EM: Good! You're a useless driver anyway, you're disgusting! My son is starving to death! Since I've had to go through so much trouble with you, you should tip ME! My app has a setting that while you're in the process of taking an order to a customer, they'll assign you another one at the same time if there's activity. Thankfully, this saved me here. Me: Can't do that ma'am. Here's your order. I dropped the food gently on the ground between us, and jogged back to my car. She was shouting something unintelligible (so much for not disturbing her autistic son), but I couldn't make out what she was saying. Unsurprisingly, she gave me a one star review (you tip online, so I got a small tip). I contacted support about it the next day.Me: Yeah, I had a crazy lady yesterday, started demanding that I pay for her order, and even that I tip her. Really rude, not sure what the deal was (oh I knew what the deal was, that's why I'm here). NSL: Hmm, which order was it? Me: It was (order number) at (address). NSL: Yikes, you're the third person to complain about her. One or two, we take with a grain of salt, but three, you're probably out. I'll try to get her deactivated. If so, her review will be off your record. Me: Thanks! Appreciate it! I feel like the entire world is better off now that she won't get deliveries from us anymore, but was the cost worth it? That remains to be seen...EDIT: My first gold! Thank you so much!
First post here. Sorry for the formatting I'm on mobile.Backstory; my older cousin molested me for 6 years and molested his brother and sister for 8 years. He was caught red handed with his bro and sis when he was still a teenager and went through the courts and "rehabilitation". This was years ago. Now he's married and has a son who's exactly a month older than my son.Cast- EA: Entitled Aunt (molesters Mom).  M: The dreaded molester cousin. EW: Molesters wife. IB: Thier son the innocent baby. ME: Magnificent Example. BF: MY boyfriend. S: my son. RCS: Random cousin's son.So at the time my son is nearing his first birthday and I get a phone call from EA. At the time I was on speaking terms with her (not anymore, not because of this) the phone call starts out pretty okay.EA: Hi Me! How's Mom life?Me: Pretty good EA. Finally seem to be getting the hang of it.EA: S is almost one years old now! IB will be one a month before S! AND RCS a month after that!Me: Wait, really?! I didn't realize all three babies were that close together.EA: Yeah! We should get all three babies together for a photo shoot after thier birthdays.I stopped cold. I promised myself I would never allow M around any of my children and BF had already threatened to kill him if he came anywhere near me ever again. I was still trying to keep the peace a bit and was trying to think of a nice way to put it.Me: That would be nice but we're pretty broke and I don't think I can make it to (city 6 hours away) anytime soon.EA: Well maybe we could come visit you!Me: That wouldn't be a good idea EA. BF and I live in a 2-bedroom apartment with a roommate...EA: We could camp out in the living room! Me: Nobody here would be comfortable with that. Besides M isn't allowed around S, so it would have to be just you and EW.EA: WHAT DO YOU MEAN M ISN'T ALLOWED AROUND S?! WE'RE FAMILY!!!Me: You, EW, IB, and pretty much everyone else can come visit, provided you stay in a hotel room, but M will never be within 30 miles of my son. He lost that privilege when he decided to molest me and your other children.EA: BUT HE HASN'T DONE ANY OF THAT STUFF IN YEARS?! Can't we all just forget about that? It happened so long ago?"Long ago" was about 6 years at this point... And EA refuses to talk about what M did most of the time and refuses to use the words molested or raped when she does talk about it. She just says vague words like stuff and things.Me: EA, NO! I'm not going to feel bad for not letting a convicted child molester around my son! He may be "reformed" or whatever but that doesn't erase his past actions and I'm not going to risk the safety of my child.EA: Well what if we just show up at your door?Me: Well then M better learn how to run fast because BF knows about what he did to me and he already wants to kill him. The only reason he hasn't is because M lives in (city 6 hours away).EA: BUT WE'RE FAMILY!!!Me: You are. HE isn't.EA: (hangs up)I thought that was the end of that discussion. I had to calm down my VERY protective BF from driving to city 6 hours away and killing M just to keep him away from S. I told him that I put my foot down and I don't think anyone would bother me about it. BOY was I wrong! The next day I get a phone call from an unknown number.Me: Hello?MW: Hi is this garnetstrongerthanyou?Me: Yes. Who's this?MW: it's MW. M's wife. I had met this woman once at a wedding when she was pregnant with IB. And she didn't say two words to me...Me: Oh. Hi! What's up?MW: EA and I were talking about doing a cute photo shoot with IB, RCS, and S later this year. Since they're all so close in age, what do you think?Me: (afraid to go through this again)  Well it's a good idea on paper but there's no way. BF and I are broke and I don't want to travel with an infant. But even if we could coordinate to have it in (my city) I wouldn't want to tear you away from my your husband for too long.MW: Well he could come with!Me: Not if you want me or S there.MW: Why are you doing this?Me: Excuse me??MW: We're trying to do something nice for you and you're making it impossible. Besides M is with me now. And we have a son. He's better now.At this point I was done being polite.Me: Look your husband molested me for 6 years. He is a child molester and he will NEVER be allowed around S. NEVER! If you want to risk your child that's your business. (I hung up)Thankfully I didn't ever hear anything else on the subject again. I did hear a few rumors about griping from some family members. But most of my other cousins with kids understood and my parents supported me. Tho I did feel a bit vindicated by my decision when M was caught sexting a 15 year old about 9 months laterEdit 1; Thank you so much for the support I have received. Also for the gold and silver! Holy shit!Edit 2; Since apparently some people think this is BS. Here's my trauma timeline. M is 2 years older than me, I was 5 and he was 7 when it started. He stopped with me when I was 11. 6 years. I have no clue when he started molesting his siblings but I know he was caught red-handed by EA the summer before I turned 13. Our sons are almost 4 at this point. Hopefully that clears up things for people who demand the math lines up.Edit 3; Fixed the EW/MW mixup! Sorry!Edit 4; M is currently in jail for the incident with the 15 year old. He's not divorced and his wife still brings thier son to visit him. I don't know any more information. Sorry.Edit 5; For any who are curious of why I no longer talk to EA. I posted the story here; https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/beqbsi/why_i_have_no_contact_with_my_aunt/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
Sit back and enjoy. This is long because I apparently can't do short. Many years ago, I was living in a beautiful sunny southern state. I had a cute little house that was completely fenced in: 5’ fence in front, 8’ fence on the sides and a 10’ chain link fence in the back. I'm fortunate enough to work from home. My “office” was my patio unless it was raining. My dog, Sarie *(German Shepard/Rottweiler mix)*, kept me company. At a year old, she was a big girl at 120lbs. She was generally very sweet and kind but protective. She was well trained but also had a knack for disappearing to play with her animal friends, so I kept her on a chain too if we were outside. High school Kids in the area had the tendency to use the alleyway behind my house to get to & from school. Most would stop and say “Hi” to Sarie and give her attention. She loved it. I honestly didn't mind. One day, I noticed that any time Sarie was alone outside, some kids would rattle the back fence, throw things at it, then scream and yell at Sarie. The kids would run off before I could see who they were. In case things got worse, I bought some security cameras and brought Sarie with me anytime I went inside when the kids would be around. One day, I had to grab some work in the house and left Sarie outside. Just for a moment. From inside, I heard the fence rattle and then Sarie yelp in pain. I rushed outside just in time to see a kid try to throw a rock at Sarie, along with some other kids. I was pissed!As I rushed over to Sarie, I calmly asked them: “Did it ever occur to you to wonder why I keep my dog chained in fenced yard?” Then I unhooked her. Sarie ran at my back fence and climbed over it. The kids started running down the alley with Sarie right behind them, barking away. I let her go about ½ block, then whistled for her. She came trotting back all happy as can be. I checked her over and gave her a treat. *(she was fine)*A couple of hours later, one of the kids came back with his mother *(EP)*.>EP *(screaming)*: “You fucking bitch! You had your dog attack my son! He was only having a fun time! He's just a boy! *(kid was at least 16yo)*. You scared him! It was just a joke! You had no right to do that! I'm calling the police and having that dog fucking shot!” Blah, blah, blah.I literally couldn't get a word in. Then she starts threatening me. So I called the police. The operator could hear her plain as day even though EP was at least 40 feet from me. The police showed up in about 5 minutes. 2 cars. I guess they were in the area. 4 officers. All very nice guys. 2 officers come talk to me, the other 2 talk to EP and her son. EP never stopped screaming and cussing. I explained what happened and showed the video to the officers. Show all of Sarie's vet and training paperwork. I filed a report. Asked to press charges. The officers are petting Sarie all the while because she's demanding attention from her new friends. She has her happy face on. *(Yes, Sarie actually smiles)*. The 3 of us and Sarie *(on a leash)* go outside towards the other group. We're about 10 feet from them when Sarie suddenly cuts in front of me to stop me and starts growling. The skin around her face went tight; making it look like a hair covered skull. The hair on her on her back raises up. *(Sarie is very scary when she's like that)*. >EP *(screaming)*: “See! That bitch raised that dog to attack black people! Fucking racist cunt! That fucking dog needs to be put down!” *(The 2 officers that were with me were African American. So. No. That part always annoys me so I included it.)*I called back 1 of the officers that I had been talking to. He didn't want to come too close as Sarie is showing large teeth. So I moved back towards my house. As quietly as I could, I told the officer that either EP or kid were carrying a gun. That's why Sarie started getting protective. It had happened several times before. I guess to error on the side of caution *(or to shut me up)*, he decided to search EP and kid. EP had an unregistered gun. Kid had a 6” switchblade *(not legal in that state)*. So, in addition to a charge of animal cruelty, they got nailed for carrying a concealed weapon, being in possession of a firearm while on probation, resisting arrest and a couple of other charges. EP never stopped screaming the entire time this happened and while being driven away. I don't think that's how EP or kid expected to end the day. But I enjoyed it. Even better, I never saw her or her kid again and the kids stopped harassing Sarie. Edit: I'll have to look for a photo of Sarie. Unfortunately, she went over the Rainbow Bridge about 5 years ago. Edit2:Edit3: Thank you so much for the Silver! Edit 4: Thank you for the Gold. That is so great!
This happened almost 40 years ago. I'm posting it as a "thanks" for reading the other stories. This one is more funny and entitled rather than infuriating and entitled.&#x200B;My immediate family was, for the most part, perfectly normal and boring. We were not prone to outbursts and tantrums. It was very calm and quiet. Everyone got along and we were pretty happy with our boredom. I tell you that so you understand that I had absolutely no experience at all with people prone to screaming fits. You should also know that I suffer from a case of terminal morbid curiosity. I also don't give a shit. Never did. Never saw the fun in it.&#x200B;This happened when we were visiting for great aunties funeral. I was 12. CA insisted that we all go out to dinner at her favorite Italian restaurant. It was just the best, she said so and she was never wrong. The gimmick here was a little flag of Italy on the table. When you wanted more dinner rolls, you raised the flag. This is important. Flag up, you get rolls. Flag down, no rolls. Remember that.&#x200B;The 6 of us are seated, they take our drink order and bring the bread basket. The cast has a new member, PU for my poor long suffering uncle who will one day be made a saint for being married to CA for over 20 years. Some of you commented in my first post that he was an enabler. He wasn't. He was a victim as well. He couldn't leave her without leaving Emily.&#x200B;It started with the drink order.CA: We will have 5 sweet teasDad: I'll have a CokeMom: I'll have a CokeMe: Tea, no sugar (This is a mortal sin in the south)CA: Don't be silly, you can't have sweet tea without sugar!Me: I don't like sugar.CA: That's stupid. Bring her sweet tea.Waitress (winked at me): Yes, Ma'am.PU: I think I'd like a Coke as wellEmily: I'd like a Coke.CA: We drink Pepsi, not Coke. We are having sweet tea.&#x200B;The waitress brought us our requested drinks. CA was growing agitated.&#x200B;CA likes to control everything and everyone. So she told us what to order for dinner. I'm not going to get into an ethical debate here but I refuse to eat veal. She demanded we all have the veal. I refused. I knew this would set her off but, oh well. I'm not eating veal. My parents, after I had explained to them years earlier why I would not eat veal, refused to eat it as well. Did I mention I get my "I don't give a shit" quality from my parents? Well they didn't give a shit either. They were perfectly capable of ordering whatever the hell they wanted. So they did. I had lasagna. It was good. My mother's was better.&#x200B;Once we ordered what we wanted, it emboldened PU and he stepped out of line and ordered something else as well. CA was NOT. HAVING. IT.&#x200B;CA: You are getting the vealPU:No, I feel like something else tonight.CA: The veal is the best.PU: I still want something else.CA: You won't like itPU: I'm sure I will.CA: You don't know what you are talking about.PU: I know what I like.CA: Well you can't have it.PU: Yes, I can!CA: I said no!PU: Well, I'm ordering it!CA: You always get the veal!PU: Because it's your favorite and you make me. I don't even like Italian food!CA: Yes you do, it's your favorite.PU: I want the lasagna.CA: Dammit, PU, order what I tell you to order.PU: No. Lasagna.Emily: I'll have the lasagna too.CA: You can't have that, you are allergic.Emily, No, I'm not.CA: I'm your mother, I know what you can and can't eat.CA (to the waitress): Bring her the veal!&#x200B;The whole time this is going on I am looking from one to the other like watching a tennis match. Back and forth, with the pitch of her voice getting more and more shrill with each sentence. I was fairly certain that when we left bats would have been summoned. I'm just watching them and eating a dinner roll......&#x200B;The food arrives and everyone got what they wanted, even Emily, much to the fury of CA. Then it happens. PU raises the flag. CA puts it down. PU puts it back up. CA takes it back down. Up and down, up and down. I see the bread guy hovering at the edge of the table.....waiting. Flag goes up and he rushes in to drop off the new basket before it can go back down. CA grabs the basket and throws it at the kid that delivered it. To save time and typing, every times CA speaks, the flag goes down. The rest of the time it goes up.&#x200B;CA: You don't need any more bread!PU: But I want more.CA: I said no.PU: I'm an adult, I can have more bread if I want.CA: No you can't.PU: Why, just tell me why I can't have more bread.CA: Because I said so. You aren't listening to me.PU: I'm hungry and want more bread.CA: You wouldn't be if you had ordered the veal!PU: Yes I would. I always am but you never let me have more bread. Tonight I get more!Me: I want some more bread too.CA: No, you have had enough.Me: No, I really think I want more.CA: Well you are wrong.Me: You seem upset.CA: That's because you people aren't listening to me.Me: Yes we are. We just don't care. We want more bread.Dad (to me while trying not to laugh at how absurd this is): You aren't helping.Me: I think you want more bread too.&#x200B;At this point the whole damn place is watching our table and the battle over the flag. I'm fairly sure there were people taking bets to see who would win. In the middle of the confusion, a nice lady sitting at another table nearest Emily, tapped her and slipped their fresh bread basket to her. Emily took a roll and slipped it to me. I took one and slipped it to my father, then it went to my mother who, after taking a roll for herself slipped one onto PU's plate. CA saw it and grabbed for it. PU was faster. He shoved the whole thing into his mouth at once. It was a big roll.&#x200B;The waitress approached the table to check to see if we needed anything (Xanax was unfortunately not on the menu) and CA demanded she bring the check.&#x200B;Me: I want dessert. Chocolate cake.PU: Sounds great! I'll have some.Emily: Me too.Dad: I'll have apple pie.Mom: I'll have cheesecake. Bring cheesecake for CA. She loves cheesecake.CA: NO! We are not having dessert. We are getting the check and leaving. NOW!Dad: No, we aren't.CA: Well I'm leaving. You can all walk home.Dad: I drove. It's our car.CA: I know, give me the keys.Dad. Nope.CA: You have to give me the keys. I live here. You are just visiting.Dad: Yes, I'm just visiting. With my family. In our car.CA: It's MY state!Dad: I don't care. It's my car and you can't have it. You're a terrible driver anyway.CA: No I'm not!Dad: You drive the wrong way on the freeway.CA: No I don't. It's the other cars going the wrong way!Dad: You get lost in your own neighborhood.CA: Not always.Dad: You are not driving my car.CA: Yes I am!Dad: No you aren't.&#x200B;That ladies and gentlemen, continued while we ate dessert, paid the check (my father was buying,) As we walked to the car, and for the entire trip back to their house. My father drove. We dropped them off and went back to our hotel room.Dad: Has your sister always been this crazy?Mom: No, it started when she was about three.Dad: What happened?Mom: She started speaking in complete sentences.Dad: Ah......
So let me tell y’all about how this EM tried to have me be her free babysitter/lifeguard. We just got one of those above ground pools you setup yourself that is 4 ft deep and 14 feet round. We spent the majority of 2 days prepping and filling it and letting it warm. Finally yesterday it was ready, and my daughter asked if she could invite a little girl she is semi friendly with from down the street to come swim with her. Since they are 8 they are tall enough to stand with heads above water I said ok. Well her little friend brought her toddler sister, who is probably on the younger side of two. definitely too small to stand with head above the water. Well I tell friend that little sister can’t get in the water unless her mom is here to watch her, and send her home with the message. They both come back and she says “mom said she’s fine in her float and I can watch her.” And I said “no it’s not fine, I do not think an eight year old is responsible enough to watch a toddler in a pool, and I am not going to be the one watching her either. You need to tell your mom either she comes to watch your little sister or she is not getting in the pool.” They both go home and then BOTH COME BACK!! At this point I am livid and walk back to their house with them and pound on the door. No answer. I keep knocking, and then the garage door starts to open with this woman backing her car out!! I quickly went and stood at the end of the driveway with all the kids in tow, both of hers and both of mine. She gets out of her car all pissed off, and asks me what my problem is?! I tell her my problem is that I’m not her babysitter, and that I am definitely not going to be responsible for keeping her baby from drowning in MY swimming pool on MY property! She then proceeds to start baby talking her own kids saying “I’m so sorry babies the mean lady isn’t going to let you swim, I’m so sorry princesses” and on and on. of course toddler bursts into tears, and then EM screams at me “look what you’ve done!! You’ve made her cry and ruined her day! Hope you are proud of yourself!!   She then snatches up little sister who is screaming and tosses her in the car, and screams at friend to get in too. Friend is red in the face, and you can tell she is so embarrassed and just mumbles sorry, while climbing in the car. EM then proceeds to peel out of her own driveway and we walk back home. Bitch.*spelling errors because I’m pissed just thinking about it lolSince it seems to be assumed, i was NOT leaving the kids unattended. I was right beside the pool doing yard work and planned on continuing once all the kids were in the pool. I did not want to watch a small toddler in the pool as she would require extreme supervision, Like sitting and staring directly at her kind of supervision.  She could not even stand with her head above water. Also on top of that, my rule was refused when I asked politely the first time and demanded the second time, and then this woman tried to leave! After knowing I said no! For anyone who is saying “well you could have just watched her” no I couldn’t! I didn’t want too, and I don’t need a reason not to be a free babysitter for a tiny toddler that I have literally never met.
Here’s a little history of me so this makes more sense. I’m nonverbal due to an injury and communicate exclusively via writing and sign language, unless I want to feel like I’m pouring half-molten nails down my throat.DH, My Husband. EM, Entitled Mother. PK, Poor Kid.I love eating at restaurants. Dennys, Applebees, little family-owned Mexican and chinese places, etc. With that means I gotta get my food, which my husband typically orders for me to avoid me playing a game of charades with the waiter/waitress. We were eating out and apparently this was wrong. So we were getting our food and this little kid near us, maybe 8 or 9, was watching us since the restaurant was fairly empty. Right after the server leaves the kid can audibly be heard speaking with his mother, a woman probably in her mid to late forties.  PK: Mommy! What about her?  EM: (She wasn’t paying attention, I’d assume) Hmm? What was that PK?  PK: He ordered for both of them!  EM: He what?  PK: The girl didn’t talk to him  EM: That’s not right, let’s go see if there’s a reason PK.  At this point she takes a few steps over towards us, PK in tow.  EM: Hi you two  DH: Hello?  EM: Who is this? (She motions towards me) Your girlfriend?  DH: Close enough, do you need something?  EM: Do you do that often?  DH: Do what often?  EM: Order for her?  DH: All the time.  EM: Could you please stop that?  DH: I’d rather not.  EM: I’m asking nicely.  PK: Can she not talk?  DH: Basica- EM cuts him off: Just don’t do it again, I don’t want my kid to grow up to be some barbarian.  DH: No, feel free to leave us alone.She leaves with a huff and that seemed to be it for the night at first, as we got our food we started talking (signing), both clearly a little confused about what this strange woman’s issue was. Now, when I’m saying crazy in sign language I use the ever-known finger-pointing-to-head crazy, which I happened to start using right as she re approached us.  EM: What are you two doing?  DH: Please go away ma’am.  EM: I’m not going to let you teach my kid gang signs. So stop it.  DH: We’re not teaching anything, it’s si-  EM: I don’t care what it is, stop it. Just “talk” like normal people. She physically put air quotes on the word talk, classy. She soon walked away, and we continued our conversation with her angrily staring at us and trying to “shield” her kid from the terrific gang signs up until they left. On behalf of all people who don’t talk I’d like to apologize for encouraging gang culture. /s
Long time lurker, first time poster. Sorry for the long post, but this is a funny one.&#x200B;I always thought these crazy people who don't mind their own business must be a rare breed and that I would never encounter one of them, but somehow I did.&#x200B;So a little bit of background before I start, I was born in Pakistan, but came to Canada when I was 3. But by that time, I could already speak in Urdu, Punjabi and Hindi (the languages are fairly similar in many regards), and then I came to Canada and English was my 4th language. As I grew up, I also learned Arabic, French and Japanese to varying competencies, but all within the realm of conversational. Having grown up in Canada, I have no "accent" when I speak in English, so you wouldn't be able to tell me apart from a Caucasian person if you spoke with me over the phone. But also having learned so many languages, I'm able to pronounce a lot of sounds fairly accurately, so I sound authentic in all languages that I speak in to all but native speakers. Most of the languages that I know sound different enough from each other that someone that doesn't know them can still tell that the language is different.&#x200B;I've traveled back home to Pakistan a few times, and I would always encounter those beggars who come with elaborate stories. Like, my wife is sick and she needs surgery, and I managed to get money for that, but I need money for the flight to reach her, etc. I came up with a fun counter to that which was that I would act like I didn't understand them at all and would start speaking in a different language that they wouldn't know. Japanese was my go-to language while in Pakistan. The reaction those people would have was quite hilarious.&#x200B;As per apparently new rules, instead of acronyms, I'll use fake names. I'll keep them all 5 letter names so the columns line up decently enough. So anyway, on to my story now.&#x200B;**The Cast:****Karen** \- The star of the show**Jimmy** \- Karen's husband, and a decent human being**Zaraf** \- Me**Wifey** \- My wife**Singh** \- Restaurant Manager&#x200B;So my wife and I were at an Indian restaurant (in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) enjoying our dinner and having a conversation. We speak in a mix of Urdu and English, just mixing with whatever feels easy. To someone listening in, they would be able to understand enough to figure out what we are talking about in most cases. We were sitting in a booth table so it was only open from one side. Karen and her family (Jimmy and her two daughters that looked like they were in their early teens), were sitting at an open table with an empty table between us.&#x200B;My wife is Pakistani like me, and what some Pakistanis like to do is eat rice with their hands. I prefer a spoon myself, but at this time my wife was eating with her hands. Apparently this Karen got offended at seeing my wife eat with her hands. When she came over, I started speaking in different languages acting like I didn't understand what she was saying in English. I'll translate what I said and put in parentheses which language I said it in.&#x200B;***Here's how it went:***&#x200B;*Karen walks over to our table with a sour expression on her face. Jimmy calls to her telling her to sit back down and leave us alone, but she ignored him. She addresses my wife directly.*&#x200B;**Karen**: What's wrong with you? Can't you eat your food in a civilized manner like the rest of us?&#x200B;**Zaraf**: (*Urdu*) Huh? What do you want? Can't you see we're eating?&#x200B;*Karen looks at me with surprise.*&#x200B;**Karen**: What did you just say?&#x200B;**Zaraf**: (*Urdu*) \[To Wifey\] Don't talk to her in English, just do what I'm doing.&#x200B;**Zaraf**: (*Urdu*) \[To Karen\] You're just a crazy woman, go sit back down.&#x200B;**Karen**: Why aren't you speaking in English?&#x200B;*My wife starts smiling and I try hard to keep a straight face.*&#x200B;**Wifey**: (*Urdu*) We are just enjoying our meal, why don't you go and sit down?&#x200B;**Karen**: I just heard you speaking in English, I KNOW you can talk in English!&#x200B;**Zaraf**: (*Urdu*) Yeah, I can but I choose to not do so.&#x200B;**Wifey**: (*Urdu*) \[To Zaraf\] I think she's getting upset.&#x200B;**Zaraf**: (*Urdu*) \[To Wifey\] I know, that's what makes this so much fun.&#x200B;**Karen**: Stop it! Talk in English like I heard you before!&#x200B;**Zaraf**: (*Japanese*) So you were listening in on our conversation? Don't you have any manners?&#x200B;**Karen**: Wait, that's some other language now. What the hell is this??&#x200B;**Jimmy**: Leave them alone Karen, they don't speak English.&#x200B;**Karen**: I KNOW THEY DO! They're just pretending not to.&#x200B;**Jimmy**: It doesn't matter, just sit down.&#x200B;*I start waving toward her table.*&#x200B;**Zaraf**: (*Japanese*) That's right, go back to your table you loud cow.&#x200B;**Jimmy**: Karen they aren't doing anything wrong. Leave them alone.&#x200B;**Karen**: She's eating with her hands! I can't let the girls learn her uncivilized ways!&#x200B;**Zaraf**: (*Hindi*) \[To Wifey\] Start licking your fingers.&#x200B;*My wife starts licking the rice on her right hand off the top parts of her fingers and that makes Karen rage even more.*&#x200B;**Karen**: OH MY GOD! Look at how gross she is being!&#x200B;**Jimmy**: Stop looking at her if you don't like it then!&#x200B;**Zaraf**: (*Arabic*) Hey you dumb bitch, do you behave this way everywhere you go?&#x200B;**Karen**: He changed languages again! I know he did! His accent changed!&#x200B;**Zaraf**: (*Japanese*) Yep, and I can keep changing.&#x200B;**Karen**: SPEAK IN ENGLISH!&#x200B;**Jimmy**: You must have heard them wrong. They don't know English. Leave them alone.&#x200B;**Karen**: Then why are they living here? They don't deserve to live here if they don't know English.&#x200B;*I was having a hard time keeping a straight face, so I disguised it by raising my voice and appearing angry. I gestured towards her and then pointed at her table.*&#x200B;**Zaraf**: (*Arabic*) Are you so dumb you can't even listen to your husband? Go sit down and stop embarrassing yourself!&#x200B;**Karen**: YOU DON'T DESERVE TO BE HERE! GET OUT!&#x200B;*At this point, the restaurant's manager Singh shows up to see what all the commotion was about. He's an Indian guy with a pretty heavy accent when he spoke in English, so I knew he'd speak either Hindi or Punjabi.*&#x200B;**Singh**: Excuse me, can you please keep your voice down? What is going on here?&#x200B;**Karen**: This woman is eating with her hands and it's disgusting! She's corrupting my children with her barbaric ways.&#x200B;**Singh**: Ma'am, there are no rules that forbid her from eating with her hands. Please leave them alone or I'll have to ask you to leave.&#x200B;*Now Jimmy gets up and comes over to where Karen is.*&#x200B;**Jimmy**: Sit down Karen, you've embarrassed yourself enough! THIS is why I can't take you anywhere!&#x200B;**Zaraf**: (*Punjabi*) Ignore this dumb cow, her brain is smaller than a "ladoo" (an Indian sweet)&#x200B;*The manager starts laughing at my comment and Karen gets even redder in the face since she probably she thinks we're making fun of her.*&#x200B;**Karen**: ALL OF YOU SHOULD GO BACK TO YOUR COUNTRY!&#x200B;*Jimmy just takes her arm and leads her back to their table and sits her down, telling her to shut up. Her daughters look like they want to sink into the floor from embarrassment.*&#x200B;*I ramble a few more sentences in varying languages as a kind of venting before my wife tells me to just leave it alone.*&#x200B;*We finish our dinner about 10 min later, with Karen glaring at us the whole time. I go pay the bill and as we are walking out of the restaurant, we pass near Karen's table. I call out to Jimmy in perfect English (with no accent) while smiling and I give him a wave.*&#x200B;**Zaraf**: Hey buddy, I hope your enjoy your dinner! Have a good night!&#x200B;*Karen's eyes bulge as she screams.*&#x200B;**Karen**: I KNEW IT! SEE! THEY KNOW ENGLISH!&#x200B;*She tried to stand up suddenly, but instead ended up falling over backwards in her seat. My wife and I left the restaurant laughing before she could do anything else.*&#x200B;**TL;DR:** Karen gets upset that my wife is eating with her hands. I respond to her in various languages she doesn't understand. Hilarity ensues.&#x200B;**EDIT:** Wow! Thanks to all of the kind souls who gave me a platinum, six golds and 4 silvers! I never got them before and I'm really thankful!  **EDIT 2**: I changed the acronyms to fake names for easier reading.

HI MOM I MADE IT!This happened a couple hours ago, hilarious ending.Backstory: I live in a middle-middle upper class neighborhood, everyone is very friendly, and its right next to a school. My neighborhood is in the east side of Pennsylvania, and if anyone lives near there you will know about the snow. We got about 6 inches of snow, so of course school was cancelled. This isn't important until later but I also have a service dog.I woke up about 7 am, and decided to go outside and play with my dog, we were having fun running around when I noticed my neighbor trying to get in his car. Now I don't know what happened, and its not my business, but my neighbor is wheelchair bound. He drives his car with those special handles you attach to the pedals. Anyway, i noticed him trying and failing to get through the 6 inches of snow on his driveway, so I decided to help him out. I went to my shed, grabbed a shovel, and some rock salt. I walked over and offered to shovel his driveway so he could go wherever he needs to be. My neighbor accepted and thanked me for being so helpful, then he went back inside. Over the course of the next 45-60 minutes I shoveled his driveway, and salted it. My dog sat at the edge the whole time, ready for action like the good girl she is. After I was done, I informed my neighbor, who thanked me again, and started walking away.*suddenly the clouds become dark and it starts storming, thunder and lightning everywhere, the devil had arrived* ^(not really)The entitled mom was walking down the street and noticed me while I was finishing up, then she decided to strike ^(DUN DUN DUN).Entitled mom: EPMe: my service dog (Lol jk Me: M)&#x200B;EP: Hey, so I noticed you shoveled -neighbors- driveway and I was wondering if you could shovel mine?M: Sure, i'll do it for $10.EP: But you shoveled his driveway for free!M: If you haven't noticed, he cant move his legs, or shovel the driveway himself.EP: Well I have children and I need to drive to the store to feed them!M: Well whats stopping you from shoveling? You seem perfectly fine to me.EP: Can't you just help out a mother?M: Give me $10 and I will.EP: YOU F\*CKING MILLENNIALS HAVE NO RESPECT FOR ANYONE. I AM A HARD WORKING MOTHER AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO REFUSE WHAT I TELL YOU TO DO.This bitch has the AUDACITY to try to grab my arm and try to PULL me.M: *yanks arm away* What the f\*ck is wrong with you! Get away from me!*My dog, although on the job, is very protective of me. At this point she stands in front of me, and growls at the lady.*EP: Your dog is crazy! Shes going to attack me! You need to put down that monster! (By the way here is my little [monster](https://imgur.com/kzBg3ER), see how vicious and dangerous she is?)M:*Yells* SIC EM GIRL (dog lets out a single bark, not even that scary)EP: *RUNS FOR HER F\*CKING LIFE*M:  *takes off dogs vest so shes not on duty, and throws stick near EP. She doesn't see it* GET IT GIRL Dog takes off towards the stick, EP turns around and a look of sheer terror fills her face as she sees my dog barreling towards her.M: *Laughing my ass off*I went home after that, and gave her extra treatos and pats for doing a big protec.Hope everyone near me has a wonderful snow day!

So my parents kinda treat me like a maid, I do all laundry, housekeeping, washing, cleaning, basically everything. So I recently attempted suicide, yesterday actually, and I’m in the hospital writing this and I’m actually allowed my phone which is kinda cool.So when I woke up after having my stomach pumped and recovering, the nurse went to get my family. They come in and immediately started yelling.EM: WHY DID YOU PULL THIS SHIT? IMAGINE THE PAYMENTS FOR THIS FUCKING ROOM AND AMBULENCEED: WHO WILL WASH THE DISHES? DO LAUNDRY? YOU FUCKI-N(nurse): I’m sorry but you have to leave, she is in a fragile mental state (I started crying almost immediately after they began yelling)EM: SHE IS OUR DAUGHTER! WE HAVE TO BE HERE!N: No M’am, please leave, she is very sensitive-ED: FUCKING BITCH OF A NURSE! I BET YOU HAVE BEEN DOING NOTHING THIS ENTIRE DAY LAZY SHIT! You know that thing people think where nurses get a lot of breaks and are lazy? Yes my parents are those types of peopleEM: LEAVE US!N: M’am I need you to stop cursing and leaveEM: FINE!So they left.  I never thought my parents entitled as they did defend me to certain things like my entitled Aunt saying it was my fault i was raped and more of her bullshit. But they are actually extremely entitled, this is one instance of my parents secret entitlement. They were yelling outside of my room as well, they were very pissed about my attempt, obviously.
So, sorry for any grammatical errors, but I am Italian and I do not know English very well. Also sorry if this is not an incredibly long or exciting story, but I thought it would be funny to read.This happened a couple of weeks ago. It was the day of my grandmother's funeral. She died in a hospital, and I was outside talking to the owner of the funeral company. This dude was also my Godfather, and I had a very good relationship with him. It might sound weird that my godfather is the owner of a funeral company, but to me, it's not. He's known me since I was a baby and he treated me like I was his son. Also to me his job is just like any other job, and it even has it's benefits.Anyways, here we go.I was, and still am, 17.This story's cast is :EM: entitled mother;GF: my godfather (not girlfriend)EK: entitled kid (even though he doesn't play a huge role in the story)Me: yours trulyWe were just outside the hospital, talking to each other. Parked in front of us were all the company vehicles, including the one you are all thinking about.All of a sudden, EM approached us.EM: hello.Me: uh.... Hello.EM had her kid just next to her and he was holding a drink.EM: I was wondering if my son could take a ride on the limousine.She then pointed her finger to the hearse (I think it's called like that in English)It took me a while to respond for two reasons.The first one was because that day I had so many thoughts going through my head, and a stranger coming to me out of nowhere caught me by surprise. I am a very introverted person, and I find it difficult to talk to people I don't know.The second reason, was because I was holding my laugh. She legitimately thought that the hearse was a limousine.Me: I'm sorry to say this, but that's not-EM: Are you going to say no to a little child?At this point, I don't know what to say.Me: Miss, believe me. You don't want your son to go in that thing.EM: Ugh... Why are you so stingy? Even if he spills his drink in the limousine, it won't be a problem. You have enough money to buy a limousine, so you'll surely have enough to clean it.This is when my godfather gets in.GF: Excuse me miss. What do you want to do?EM: I want my son to ride the limousine!My Godfather then said the most epic thing I have ever heard.GF: *thinks for a bit* Well, sure he can ride the limousine. But only if he has a coffin to be in.EM is a bit confused about the response. She takes a good second look at the "limousine", and then she realized. I have no idea how she confused a hearse for a limousine. Perhaps the company logo was out of her view or something. However, when she realized the mistake, her skin got pale and she just walked away as fast as she can with her kid. Me and GF just look at each other and start laughing.This is my first post on here and I hope this goes on RSLASH because he's the best.Have a good day.Edit: thanks to everyone who has upvoted my post and made it possible for me to actually get on Rslash. It really made my day!
My partner and I purchased the house next door to my best friend. I had lived with him for close to a decade when his kids were babies, so they viewed my house as an extension of theirs, and were in and out all day, every day. I have a more flexible schedule than he and his wife, so I have them in the mornings, after school, and on days off of school. I had a pool in my yard, and because my friend's kids were still little, I installed a retractable cover and made sure it was locked so they couldn't open it. My friend's yard had one of those wood fort/climbing wall/swing set deals and a large sandbox.  Throughout the year, we spent most evenings outside, grilling, drinking, and watching the kids play/swim/whatever.&#x200B;One summer day, I came home from work a little earlier than normal, and started to prep for dinner. I heard a knock at my back door, which was odd, since my buddy's kids never knocked. I went to see who it was and discovered a mom and two kids who looked to be maybe 5-7 years old. As I opened the door, she informed me that her kids needed to use the bathroom and that I needed to come out and get the cover off my pool. I was confused and asked her to repeat herself, and she said that her kids needed to pee and that they were hot and bored with playing in the sandbox, so I needed to open up my pool.  I asked her why she was in my friend's yard and what made her think her kids were welcome to swim in my pool, or use my bathroom for that matter. She got really bitchy and told me that she had moved into the house behind us and that she had watched my buddy's kids come over all the time and I opened the pool for them. She insisted that since I was willing to open my pool for the kids next door, I should also open it for the children who lived behind me. I tried explaining the relationship between my best friend's family and mine. She claimed it didn't matter that I had known them since birth and pretty much had helped raise them, I just needed to get to know her kids too and it would be OK. &#x200B;I told her no and closed the door on her. She spent a while knocking and fussing at me through the window, and then had her kids pee in a planter on the side of the patio. When I still didn't react, she took her kids back into my friend's yard to play on the swings. I texted him to let him know what was going on, right at the moment he was letting his 300+ pounds worth of Newfies out into the yard without noticing the unwelcome visitors. The mom starts shrieking and climbs up into the fort, leaving both kids on the swings. She starts demanding that we put the dogs inside and how dare my friend let his dogs out into his own yard when her kids are clearly playing there. He tells her to GTFO and calls the police. &#x200B;When the cops arrived, she put on the whole waterworks about how her kids are just looking for friends, and my buddy's kids are somehow bullying her kids, even though they'd never met. That he invited her over just to let his dogs attack her children, blah blah blah. They eventually move her back onto her own property, then come back later to tell us they warned her about coming back.&#x200B;She lived in that house for almost a year before she and her husband divorced. During that year, I had to replace the lock over the pool cover controls 3 times, have a fencing company remove a gate at the back of my property that was meant to let the lawn mower through, and eventually pay a security company to come check on the yard any time we were going to be away for more than a few hours. We found her and her kids in our yards repeatedly, but she'd leave when we got home. What finally resolved the issue was my partner catching her in the pool. She told him she knew the man that owned the house and that he had told her it was OK to swim. He told her he was married to the man that owned the pool and that it's not OK to swim. She apparently had a bad reaction to realizing she was immersing her sons in gay water. We didn't see her again after that. 
So I've been lurking for a bit, and decided to share my EP story. This is gonna be a long one.When I was 16, I worked at the amusement park in my city. It wasn't a big one, but it wasn't small either. Most of our rides were aimed towards elementary school-aged children, though we had a few for the older kids as well. Anyways, I was a rides operator, and that day, I was assigned to a ride designed for older kids. We had to measure the kids, and they couldn't go on if they were under the height requirements no matter what, even if they had a parent with them, because it was a ride that only had a bar that went across your stomach, so someone too small could easily fall off. Entitled Mother (who we'll call EM) and her entitled brat (EB) are in line, and I can already tell the kid is gonna be too short to ride without even having to measure him. He's pretty far back, so I know it's gonna be one or two runs before he makes it on, so after I'm done loading, I tell EM that her kid is too short for the ride and that they should go try the smaller version of it on the other side of the park. She looks at me with the dirtiest stare ever and just says: We're gonna wait here.Now I have to run my ride because I need to meet certain times, so I don't argue. Time goes by and she's finally at the start of the line. I measure her kid, and of course he's like 6 inches shorter than the height requirementsMe: I'm sorry ma'am but your child is too short to ride this ride. I would recommend going over to the smaller version near the entrance of the park thoughEM: No it's fine I'm with him I'll hold himShe tries to shove me out of the way, but I'm standing my groundMe: I'm really sorry ma'am, but we don't allow people under the height limit to ride this ride. The safeties we have on it just won't hold someone too small, and your kid could fall offShe then asks to speak to my manager. I get asked that quite a lot by EPs, so I give them a call and tell her to wait on the side while I load my ride. She gets very offended, saying that she shouldn't have to wait longer for her kid to ride this ride because I couldn't do my job, and at this point I just kinda ignore her and move on. Ride runs, my team lead gets there and talks with her. He tells her that he's really sorry but that I'm right, her child can't ride this ride. Now at this point EB is throwing a tantrum, and I mean, he's rolling on the concrete like a piece of bacon in a frying pan. I'm trying my hardest not to laugh at this point. Anyways, my lead apologizes, offers her a "skip the line" ticket for the ride he's allowed to go on at the entrance, and leaves. EM is trying to calm down EB, and starts talking to him. He gets up, all smiling and happy, and stands next to the gates, watching me. Now I'm not thinking too much of this at this point, so I start loading my ride again, which has a significantly less busy line, and I have a couple of empty seats on it. As I'm doing my security checks and getting ready to run it, EM taps me on the shoulder and thanks me for my help, which I found extremely odd. I turn around to tell her that it's really no problem, and she starts apologizing and telling me that she shouldn't have acted the way she did and blah blah blah. I'm completely stunned, not really sure how to react, but I tell her it's no problem and to enjoy the rest of her day.I look back at my ride, and realize that EB isn't standing next to the fence anymore. I'm starting to get weird vibes. I look around for him and he's not anywhere to be seen. I look at EM again, who has her phone out with her camera pointing at the ride, and that's when I knew. I take my keys out the ride, and start walking towards it. It's kind of a "swing" type of thing so I couldn't see the back from where I was standing, but I knew damn well EB had snuck on. EM starts panicking, asking me what I'm doing and why I'm not running the ride. I completely ignore her and walk to the back of the ride, and lo and behold, EB is sitting there, and almost shits himself when he sees me walking towards him.He didn't have the bar properly locked AT ALL, and would've flown right out as soon as I started the ride. Now, I am mad, and I mean mad. I mean I could've gone to jail for manslaughter right here and there. I just look at him, and very sternly tell him to get off my ride. He tells me he can't and he needs help, which is fair. I mean I don't even know how he managed to get on in the first place, but I grab him and put him down, and he starts sprinting towards his mom crying. As he's running, he trips and falls down on his face. When he gets up his nose is all bloody and his knees are skinned, which is when I knew I was completely and utterly fucked.EM starts screaming like a banshee at the sight. As I'm running towards the kid to make sure he's not dead and to help him up, she runs towards me, slaps me hard across the face and starts yelling for security. I'm absolutely and completely stunned at this point. Some security guards must've heard her screaming at the top of her lungs because they come running, and the exchange goes something like this (security guard is SG)SG: What's going on here?EM: This girl assaulted my son! She threw him off the ride unto the pavement!Me: Excuse me???(Did she really want them to believe I just yeeted her child 10 feet away from where he was sitting?)EB: it's true!! She punched me tooSG: Do you want us to call the police?EM: yes! You need to arrest her!! She's mentally unstable I'm just dumbfounded at this point. My lead gets to the ride and asks what the hell is going on, and I tell him everything that happened in between sobs. There's one thing EM forgot to take into account though: there were like 15 people on the ride who saw everything. So they tell the police and the security guards and my lead and everyone else what happened, and EM quickly realized her error, as she just started running with her kid in tow as soon as she saw people asking the other guests questions.They caught her pretty quickly, and I pressed assault charges against her. Needless to say, I handed in my resignation that same dayEdited because of some spelling errors
So, basic information: Me and my best friends where in a beach, just chilling. One thing I need to inform is that my best friend is on the big breasted side of the spectrum. So, like any big breasted woman, bikinis are a nightmare to her, she always is stared at, and that makes she really uncomfortable. Now to the story.&#x200B;Me and her where in a more secluded part of the beach, we had swam and we decided to sit a bit. When we come back to our chairs a family has settled down near us. The mom was in her late 30's and the dad was in his early 50's, they had a child with them, a nineish years old boy. We didn't pay mind to them, we just sit on our chairs and talk for a bit, I noticed the dad of the family looking at my friend but paid no mind. I decide to pick something to drink, there was a bar nearby, I asked my friend if she wanted something, she asked me for a lemonade. I go to the bar and se the EM coming near me. I waited in the line, until EM comes to talk to me. EM: Entitled Mother Me: ... A unicorn.&#x200B;EM: "Hi, I saw that you and your friend are nearby me and my family" I just nodded to her."I think your friend is really beautiful, but she is showing too much cleavage" I looked at her, trying to think what to respond to this.Me:Well, she can't be faulted for being born with big breasts can her?" She looked at me like she was expecting me to agree with her.EM:"Well she could not use a bikini that small" She said with a somewhat  annoyed voice.Me: " She can do whatever she wants lady" She become red at that, I don't think that this woman has ever heard someone disagree with her before.EM:"She is looking like a slut! My child will be traumatized!" I looked back to where my friend is sitting, I have a clear view of her and the EM's family. Her child is doing sand castles, a cute view I might add, and her husband is starring hard at my friend who was passing sunscreen at the time. So, the problem was not her child, it was her husband. Me:"Well I can't do much lady, now please leave me alone" Finally it was my turn, so I pick my drinks and ignore the EM. She wasn't happy about it though.EM:"Don't you dare ignore me young man, I'm not finished" I just look at her and took a sip of my drink before saying.Me:"Lady, your kid isn't even looking at my friend, your husband in other hand..." I pointed at her husband who was staring at my friend with hungry eyes. She looked shocked, and just starting walk to her husband, I go to my friend, gave her drink and sit beside her, watching the wife furious whispers to her husband. Not long after, my friend and I decided to leave. &#x200B;I didn't tell my friend about the crazy lady, she has confidence issues enough. At least I didn't see this family ever again. 
At first I wasn't sure if this was an entitled parent story, because I think this woman is just plain crazy. But after reading a few of these I have figured out that crazy and entitled are one in the same.Years ago this new neighbor of mine (she had recently moved to a house on the next street over) kept trying for the better part of a summer to use me as a free babysitter. It started when her kid, who was really a cute, well behaved kid about 7 years old, showed up at my door at 7:15 in the morning. We were all just waking up and getting around so I told him that my boys weren't ready to play yet and to come back in a few hours. That is when the kid told me his mom had gone to work. This seemed a bit odd to me so I brought him in and tried to call his mom. (This was the time of only land lines) Sure enough she was gone. So I brought him in and fed him breakfast. He stayed with us the rest of the day and he got along well with my two boys who were 5 and 10. I had only talked to his mom about two times, so I had no idea why she would think this was a good idea. When his mom came home I walked him over so I could talk to her. I told her not to do that again. I told her that I would be willing to watch him on occasion if asked first but not everyday. Her response was: "Well, what else do you have to do all day?"This kind of took me by surprise. I tried to tell her that I work at home on commisions. She rolled her eyes and told me that being an artist isn't a 'real job' and besides I was married so I didn't need to work. I should have pointed out to her that she was married and working, but I felt myself getting angry and I didn't want to argue with her."Just don't do that again." I said to her. "You have teenage kids home for the summer, have them babysit." She frowned at me and said: "They work.""I said "So do I!"Then I went home.The next morning at 7:15 the kid sheepishly shows up again.Once again I bring him in and feed him breakfast and later lunch.Once again I took him to his home and once again told his mother to please not do that again. She actually tried to tell me that it was my neighborly duty to watch him and I told her that if she sent him tomorrow I wouldn't be there because of a doctors appointment. She said that as a babysitter I should have given her several days notice about this. I angrily told her I was NOT a babysitter and then went home.The next morning I made my 7 a.m. appointment. (Blood work, that is why it was so early) I did some grocery shopping afterward and it was about 10 a.m. when I got home. The poor kid was waiting for me on my porch. He had been there for nearly 3 hours and the little guy was scared and hungry.That night when I took the kid home I was angry. I told her how the kid was scared and alone. She actually said that she had told me I hadn't given her enough time to find anyone else and that his being alone was my fault. I pointed at her and said: "I am NOT a babysitter! Don't send him over again!"That night this woman had her adult nephew call me to scream at me for not being home when his poor aunt dropped her son off. How dare I leave a small child alone like that? I told the nephew that his aunt KNEW I wasn't home so it was HER that left a child all alone. I said that I had repeatedly asked his aunt NOT to send the kid over anymore and I was NOT a babysitter. This nephew freaked out at me when I said that and I hung up on his screaming at me.This worked for two wonderful quiet days. Then right back to it. I tried everything, but this woman insisted that it was my neighborly duty to babysit and would tell me as much. Finally I decided that to solve this problem I would just get a job outside of my home and that way she would have to stop. (I was too much of a pacifist back then. I no longer am) I landed an interview for a position at the local library and I was ecstatic. I told the woman to keep her son home because I had arranged for my kids to stay with their grandmother while I went to this interview. The next morning I drove to my mother in law's house and took my kids inside.When I went to leave I found this woman's kid waiting for me in my car!  She had actually followed me there and put her son in my unlocked car and then zoomed off while I was dropping off my boys. My mother in law wasn't the most flexible person in the world and she adamantly refused to watch an extra kid. I had to cancel my interview. I was livid.I toyed with several ideas at this moment. I could take the kid to her job and leave him with her...or I could call the police and CPS. I really wasn't sure how stable this woman's job was and I didn't want her to get fired, and when I went to go call the CPS I chickened out because it really wouldn't be fair to the little boy. Besides I had heard really scary stories about CPS. In the end I just waited for her to come home. I left the boy at my house with my hubby (I planned on doing a lot of cussing) and I stomped over to her house and met her before she even got out of her car. I shouted at her. I told her she was dense, stupid, moronic and crazy.  I told her that she had lost me my job interview and if she sent her kid over to be watched again I was going to call CPS and the police. I told her that she was violating my space and if it took going to court to get her to knock it off then so be it.She then put her hand on her hip and in her most snotty tone she said: "Well if you didn't want to sit with him, all you had to do was tell me." I really do not know how I kept from punching her right then and there, this comment was so asinine. I turned on my heels to start stomping home when I saw her husband pulling up. Now this was the first time I had ever met her husband. He worked at a job that only allowed him to be home on weekends. (I can't blame him, I wouldn't want to be around her either) But when she saw him she turned tail and RAN into her house. He saw that I was upset and asked me what had happened. I told him. Told him all of it, especially the incident at my mother in law's. The poor man was shocked. He had been told that I was being paid and he had been giving her money to pay me! He had no idea all this had been going on and he was very, very apologetic over the whole thing. In fact he  apologized again to my husband when he came over to pick up his little boy. Finally, FINALLY, she stopped sending her kid over! Later I heard from others that she was badmouthing me and warning folks about what a horrid babysitter I was but I took that as a favor. I didn't want to babysit any kids other than my own and I still hate doing so. I don't hate the kids, I love kids. It's dealing with the parents that I don't like.The kid came over only once in a while after that to play with my kids, after he called first to get permission, exactly the way it should be done. I'm sure his dad had something to do with that because the kid only came over on weekends. This is one of a few stories I have involving this crazy lady. Her only entertainment in life seems to be seeing how bizarre she can act in this neighborhood. I'm luckier than my other neighbors in the fact that she leaves me alone now, and I'm very happy with that.
My pregnancy was okay up until the last month. It was 95 degrees outside, I was retaining so much water, my sandals hardly fit on the biggest setting and I was constantly in pain. It sucked. I run (waddle) to the store for a couple last minute things for baby, and I was sooo relieved that there was a parking spot for preggos & parents near the entrance. I pulled in and took a few moments to chug water and gather my things when I notice a car pull up to my left. They were half in the handicap parking stall and yelling something out the window. I rolled my window down and hear ‘you shouldn’t be in that spot you don’t have kids. My son shouldn’t have to walk from the back of the parking lot’ or something to that effect, I was a little stunned to be yelled at tbh. I calmly told her that I was VERY pregnant, and this stall was for pregnant women too. She kept talking to her son, but at me, you know what I mean? ‘Sorry son, you have to walk in the heat, because this lady parked in our spot’.So, I opened my door and hoisted my giant, land-whale-esque body out of my car. She was still turned around ‘talking to her son’ and when she finally saw me, I was about 3 ft away from her window. I bent down (lol, no, I tilted my head down) and said ‘do you see how pregnant I am? I think you and your son will be okay walking.’ And then I saw the son... he was like 7?!? The kid can walk. She just sighed and drove away. I was so pissed. I wish I said more to her. 
I was playing on a minecraft server with 5 friends at the time this happened and this new kid joined our game and our Skype call. He kept breaking our builds and demanding we give him stuff.We originally decided to ban him, but we wanted to have some fun, so we kept killing him. The Skype call was basically 6 guys laughing and a little kid screaming, calling us hackers.We were talking on Skype when EM called."LET MY SON PLAY ON THE SERVER, YOU UNGRATEFUL D\*CKS!""No," we all said at the same time."MY HUSBAND IS A LAWYER AND HE WILL SUE YOU AND I WILL CALL THE POLICE FOR HARASSMENT!""Shut up, lady!""DON'T YOU TALK TO ME LIKE THAT! MY SON DESERVES ALL YOUR ITEMS MORE THAN ALL OF YOU COMBINED!""F\*ck off, woman!""YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO F\*CKING SWEAR! ONLY ADULTS ARE ALLOWED TO USE THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE!"One of us makes a christian minecraft server meme and she gets really pissed."HOW DARE YOU INSULT MY RELIGION! YOU ARE ALL GOING TO HELL!""ALRIGHT. WHERE DO YOU LIVE?"We start making up addresses like "69 weed st" and "420 f\*ck off ave"."THAT'S IT! I'M LEAVING!""About time."She left and blocked us.Me and my friends still joke about that incident.Edit: Thanks for the awards!Edit edit: to all you people from Pyro's video, yes, I am Pielord.
So first a little background. This happened about 3-4 years after I moved out of my parents house and have been living independently. Then one day I get this string of texts from my mom. Mom: "Hay, how have you been doing? What you up to two weeks from now?"Me: "I've been doing alright, I've started lifting weights and exercising more. I don't think I'm doing anything too exciting next week. Why you ask?" Mom: "perfect! Me and <boyfriend> are going on a trip and need you to house sit and watch the dogs for us" Me: "sorry but I can't just leave for a week" Mom: "please, the dogs miss you and I'd really hate to put them in the kennel" Me: "Sorry but I have a job, I can't just go missing for a week" Mom: "why can't you drive to work from my house?" Me: "because it's a 2.5hr coummute each way" Mom: "you have vacation days, right? Just use them" Me: "no" Mom: "please. I'd feel really bad about putting <dog's name> in the kennel. You know how much she hates it" Me: "you obviously don't feel *that* bad about doing it" Then I hear nothing from her until the day before they have their trip. Mom: "Hay, we're leaving for our trip today and I was wondering when you were going to be here? I want to show you some things before we leave" Me: "What part of our last conversation gave you any idea that I agreed to this?"Mom: "that's very rude of you and no way to speak to your mother. Now can we expect you here by 5?And at that point I just put my phone on silent and stopped talking to her. EDIT: My landlord dosnt allow pets, so I couldnt keep them for a week. Also the dogs went to the kennel and came out just fine. However this all happened a while ago and both dogs have passed sense then. One to stomach cancer, the other to old age :( Ill miss you, <dog's name> and <other dog's name>
EDIT: Spelling and formatting. EDIT 2: Wow! Didn't expect such a response!  My sincere thanks to you all! One point, for clarification. This happened about 13 years ago and I have been out of the army for 10 years myself. Thanks again for all the up votes and kind words! !!!!!EDIT 3: Some acronym definitions. I forgot that not everyone has military experience, apologies.  NCO- Non commissioned Officer. BFE- Butt Fu**ed Egypt PSG- Platoon Sergeant DC- District of ColumbiaTOG- The Old GuardEDIT 4: Holy cow!  Thank you again everyone!!!!This has exploded.  I got my first Silver!!!!! AND MY FIRST GOLD!!!!!!!! WOW!!Was reading a post by u/MrHouck and it reminded me of this incident.   Backstory: Joined the Army right out of high school. During basic training,  I voulenteerd for a unit within the army known as The Old Guard. (TOG from here on) TOG is responsible for ceremonies in the DC area and funerals in Arlington National Cemetery, amongst other duties. TOG consists of units you may have heard of,  such as the US Army Drill Team and the Sentinels of the Tomb of the Unknowns, as well as lesser known platoons such as the Presidential Guns Salute Battery and the US Army Continental Color Guard and is the oldest active unit in the army.  (I only say this to emphasize that TOG isn't some unheard of rifle company from BFE, it's a fairly big deal in the army and in the DC area in general.) Story time: So no shit,  there we were. It's the 4th of July in DC. Big celebration, all kinds of stuff going on,  I'm sure you can picture it.  Most of the celebration goes on in front of the Capitol on the National Mall. As part of the festivities,  my unit,  the Presidential Guns Salute Battery fires the bassline for the performance of the 1812 overture. (3 inch anti-tank guns firing blanks) Only the more seasoned guys in the platoon get picked to do it,  so the rest of us are given a cordoned off area in the very front. We bring some food,   some chairs,  our families,  and we have a cookout during the day  and watch the show when it starts. During the earlier parts of the day, it isn't too crowded,  but as evening draws near it becomes packed in nearly shoulder to shoulder.  Fortunately,  as I mentioned before,  we had our own area at the front roped off from the general public giving us ample room to have our cookout. (Perk of working for the government) Throughout the day we would have people politely ask if they could join us, we said no but were always respectful. We weren't in uniform,  but we had our unit T-shirts on so we were still representing the army. Enter Karen. It's midway through the afternoon,  still a few hours before the show.  We're enjoying the weather and the time off. I happened to be near the edge of our area when I hear someone behind me. I turn around and there she is, pinched face and a haircut that says 'I want to speak with your manager's manager. '**Karen**: Excuse me young man,  could you ask your father to take this rope down? This is supposed to be a public area for everyone and my kids can't see the Capitol. (Mind you there are signs hanging on the rope  every 5 feet explaining the purpose of the rope)**Me**: (with my best PR smile) I'm sorry ma'am, this area is reserved for members of TOG and their families. If you'd like to come back a little closer to dusk, we'll be taking the rope down around then. **Karen**: TOG? I've never heard of that before. **Me**: (always happy to drop knowledge) Ma'am, TOG is the primary ceremonial unit for the US Army and escort to the President of the US of A**Karen**: I don't see the president. Shouldn't you be escorting him or something then? *rolls eyes***Me**: Uhh.... ( I had no idea how to respond to that,  fortunately I was saved. )**Platoon Sergeant** (PSG from here on): (Places hand on my shoulder) Good afternoon ma'am, I'm Sergeant First Class Guyincharge (obviously made up name) , what seems to be the problem? As I knew this was my cue to GTFO, I went back to my chair and observed their interaction. Couldn't hear anything,  but the interaction concluded with Karen walking away looking annoyed. Didn't think anything else of it until about 2 hours later. We're cleaning up our trash, breaking down the chairs and tables and such. Out if the corner of my eye I see Karen approaching again,  this time with two Capitol Police officers in tow.  PSG must have noticed too, I heard him mutter "what in the fu**?" under his breath as he walked to intercept the trio.I didn't hear all of the conversation,  but we all heard about it later.  **PSG**: Officers, what seems to be the problem?  **Cops**: (Obviously exasperated by the situation) Sergeant Guyincharge, we received a report that your soldiers were making lewd gestures and comments towards this woman's family. Is there any truth to this? **PSG**:*laughs* Absolutely not,  ive been supervising them all day,  nothing even close to that has happened today. **Cops**:(nodding as though this was what they expected) We had assumed that,  but we had to follow up.  Sorry to bother you. **Karen**: You mean your going to just let them sit there and hog up all of the space!? I drove my kids 9 hours to see this!!!!!**Cops**: Ma'am, these men are here with the expressed permission of the Capitol Police and the District of Columbia. There are signs there (points to a sign not 3 feet away) that explicitly state that. **PSG**: (trying to diffuse the situation) Ma'am, we're cleaning up our area right now,  as soon as we are done we will be removing the rope to let everyone in. If you can be patient and wait,  we can get you and your family right up front here in about 20 minuets. Karen proceeded to stare at them,  much like a cow stares at an incoming train.  Then she spun around and walked away without another word. We think it's all over,  we go back to what we were doing. We were wrong.We're just finishing up,  taking the ropes off of the pylons and stacking the pylons in the arms of another dude in the platoon. Out of nowhere,  here comes Karen, trailed by her 4 children and obviously stressed spouse.  (I'm assuming spouse,  could have been boyfriend or, baby daddy) "It's about time! Get out of my way!" Karen all but screams as she goes barreling right through Private Anotherguy. Gotta pause here for a second. To be in TOG you have to be between 5' 10" (178cm)  and 6' 4" (193cm), and maintain the army standard of physical fitness. To add to that,  TOG is an infantry unit. If you aren't aware,  infantry are generally the front line soldiers in combat, and we are trained for just that. So, suffice to say,  none of us were small,  nor weak. Karen was probably around 180ish. So when I say she barreled through this dude,  I mean it.  She put some force into it. Anotherguy goes sprawling to the ground,  steel pylons fly in every direction. A couple hit him in the face,  chipped a tooth and split his eyebrow open. One pylon bounces of the ground and hits one of Karen's fu**trophies in the leg. The kid,  probably 12 or 13, starts wailing like he lost a limb. As we are helping Anotherguy to his feet,  Karen is losing every last ounce of her shit.  Red faced,  screaming about how she's going to sue us for assault,  how we probably aren't even real soldiers,  how we've ruined her family vacation blah blah blah......At this point PSG is done with her. If Karen thought she was being loud,  she quickly learned there are few things louder than a pissed off senior NCO.With a single word he quieted everyone within 50 feet of us. **PSG**: STOP! (paused for dramatic effect) THAT IS ENOUGH. YOU HAVE BEEN HARASSING ME AND MY SOLDIERS ALL AFTERNOON. WE HAVE TRIED TO BE NICE,  WE HAVE TRIED TO BE RESPECTFUL.  YOU HAVE BEEN NOTHING BUT RUDE. NOW YOU'VE INJURED ONE OF MY SOLDIERS. THIS.  STOPS.  NOW!I think Karen might have had a small stroke right then. She stood,  mouth agape, not able to utter a single word. And then,  as if right on cue, here come those two Capitol policemen. They hadn't been far away,  and had seen the entire incident. I didn't think Karen's eyes could get any wider, until the first officer pulled out a pair of cuffs and said,  "Ma'am turn around and put your hands behind your back.  You are under arrest for assault and harassment."She tried every excuse she could think of,  but the cops were having exactly none of her shit. They talked to Anotherguy, he wanted to press charges. So they carted her off. I don't know what the father did with the kids,  they dissappeared when the cops took Karen.Come to find out after Anotherguy comes back from the court hearing,  Karen had been carrying 3 bottles of pills that weren't hers,  and 2 stolen credit cards when the cops searched her.  No idea what kind of time she got, but  it wasn't enough. After all was said and done,  we watched the 1812 overture and laughed about Karen for weeks afterward. Anotherguy was fine, a chipped tooth and a little bit of bruising. Nothing major fortunately. TLDR: Karen tries to bully an infantry platoon out of our cordoned off area during 4th of July celebration on the national mall in DC. She gets arrested. She has drugs. We laugh for a long time. Moral of the story. Read signs.  Don't fu** with the infantry.
I work IT for a small company.  I support about 25 people total.  Anything tech related owned by the company and I am involved in it.  I like my job.  Most of the folks working here are good people even though some of them are very difficult to train on computers.EP is a middle aged woman who, as far as I can tell, gets paid more than I do to do about 45 minutes of work a day that she stretches into a full 8 hour shift.  She can't really even do that 45 minutes of work correctly most of the time and I've had to come and retrain her on the software we use several times a month.  EP also refuses to listen when I am helping her with tech issues and has something new to complain at me about every week.  I'm told she only got the job because her dad and the owner of the company are old drinking buddies.  Well as annoying as EP is I was able to mostly ignore her until this incident last week.I am in my office working on something when EP comes in with a laptop, some cables, and an iPad.  She sets them down on my desk and just looks at me without saying a word.Me: "Uh...whats all this?"EP: "My son's laptop and my iPad are having trouble.  Can you fix them?"Me: "Sorry EP.  I don't work on personal devices.  If it isn't owned by the company I won't work on it.  You'll have to go to a shop or something."EP: "Oh come on!  You fix this kinda stuff all the time.  I bet it takes you 5-10 minutes tops to get them running.  Then you can get back to whatever else you wanna fix."Me: Pushing the items back toward EP "Sorry EP.  Not happening."EP: Turning several shades of purple and red at this point "What the hell is wrong with you!  You sit around all day doing nothing, and when you finally come out of your office its to fix things that you obviously screwed up because you're incompetent!  Just fix the fucking things so I can take them home and use them again.  I don't know why Owner even keeps you around you are so useless!"Me: "Yeah I'm gonna have to ask you to leave my office so I can get back to work."I go back to working on things and EP grabs her stuff and storms out slamming my door behind her.  I get a call about 20 minutes later from the owner asking why EP was demanding I be fired.  She had told him that I had laughed in her face and refused to help her.  She even said I threatened to never help her with IT problems at work again because I was mad she called me out on being lazy.  I explained what actually happened and offered to send Owner a copy of the camera footage of the entire incident since there is a camera overlooking my entire office.  Owner requested the footage so I sent it to him.I get in the next day and I realize EP isn't there.  I ask around and apparently Owner called EP into his office and spoke with her about the incident.  She tried to double down on her lies when Owner showed her the footage (including audio) and caught her in the lie.  He then offered to let her take some time off to cool her head before coming back to work, but that he'd expect her to make an apology to me for her behavior.  This enraged EP who everyone could hear even through closed doors and after screaming about how awful a person I was she stormed out of Owner's office, grabbed her things, and shouted "I FUCKING QUIT" before leaving.  So she's gone for good.Bitch was so unwilling to own up to her own poor behavior and apologize to me that she threw away a cushy job making way more money that she is likely to make anywhere else around here.  What a fucking idiot.  On the plus side, without EP here constantly complaining I am getting a bit more work done each day.
Details: I am 17 and live in the UK. This happened around December of last year. It happened in Lidl to be exact. Now this is going to be a very long read so prepared.EM: Entitled MumEK: Entitled KidMy mum asked me to go grocery shopping because she was quite busy with something and I agreed to go so I went to Lidl. I spent around 10 minutes looking for things on the shopping list. I decided to get a treat for myself because why not and so I got some Fin Carré chocolate (note: this chocolate wasn't sold at the till in this location). I finally finished finding everything and made my way to the till. I was standing in line while using my phone just minding my business until this overly loud parent with her very hyperactive kid who looked around 8 came behind me in the line. EM: "You wouldn't mind letting us go in front of you, would you?" I looked down on her cart which seemed to be a lot more full than mine and I decided I'm not in a rush so why not and I replied "Sure." and subtly smiled. She thanked me and went on to go in front of me. My impression of this woman seemed normal until this happened.The EK said as he was pointing to my cart: "Mum, look it's that chocolate that you promised me to buy next time we go shopping"EM: "Oh yes darling I just remembered"The EM looked up to me and said: "May I grab the chocolate bar? The little one's been eager to get it."Now this chocolate is somewhat far from the tills in this location and as mentioned earlier, isn't sold at the tills either so getting a new chocolate bar for myself would've been a chore.I replied: "I'm sorry I don't think I can give you the chocolate, it's quite far from the tills"Her smile quickly turned into a death stare and she said in a loud voice: "Right, I don't care how far this chocolate is from here, now someone like you is more than capable of getting a new bar so stop making George cross!"I replied: "I don't care how capable I am, I'm not going anywhere and this chocolate is staying in the cart"Now there was a lot going through my head at this point but I remember how the EK was reaching inside my cart trying to grab the chocolate so I quickly grabbed it myself and held it in my hand.EK: "Mum the guy took the chocolate!"EM: "Right I've had enough"The EM reached to my hand to grab the chocolate but I moved in time and decided to go directly to the cashier and ask him to call a manager. Now the cashier seemed to have witnessed everything and so he informed the manager about what happened. No more than 2 minutes of me awkwardly standing and the manager arrives.She walks up to the EM and quietly asks her to leave and the EM kept trying to incriminate me somehow until she finally paid for her groceries and left. Me, the cashier and the manager all had a laugh about it after she left. Now that I think about it, that scene wasn't worth a chocolate bar but oh well.
Apologies if I mess up anything. My daughter told me to post her When I was first married, money wasn’t that easy to come by. I had a form of leukemia that took up most of our money. Due to this we can’t just spend money like we wanted to. God bless my husband for being such a sweetheart. We were only early 20s and he still pushed through this for us.  December 23rd is my mothers birthday. She is an awful person. She tried to get me pregnant at 14 because she wanted more money from the state. That’s an entirely different story I’ll post on here if people ask As this was 20 years ago, we didn’t really have the same type of cell phones we have today. So I didn’t know until I got home from treatment that my mom had called me multiple times. 3 minutes later, I counted, she shows up at the door. She asks for her money. Both of us are confused of course. She wants her birthday money, which I’ve never given before to her. She wanted 608 dollars. That exact amount. When I told her no, we can’t afford that, she lost it. Screaming at me, calling me a whore and an entitled bitch. She gave birth to me so I should do what she says And then I say I’m an adult and I don’t have to listen. I was angry and tired and I just threw up a few minutes ago. This set her off. She grabbed a kitchen knife and ran at me, while my husband is trying to hold her back. She stabbed me right between 2 ribs, but didn’t pierce any organ, thank God. I don’t know what happened in my husbands mind but he snapped. He broke her arm backwards in rage, while screaming something I don’t even think was a human language. He called the police and she was arrested while I was taken to the hospital. Even more bills to pay, but surprisingly that was taken care of by a domestic violence victims foundation.  She got 7 years in prison. I moved out and moved to Louisiana. This morning, I got a call from my sister that she passed away last night. How she did I don’t know. Don’t care. She took her entitlement and almost killed her own daughter because of it 
I'm going to preface this by saying that brevity is not my strong point (sorry). It was hard to know what to include since there's a lot of backstory. If nothing else, writing this felt good because it was a very traumatic time, and getting it off my chest is helpful. Hopefully no one thinks I'm the entitled one.Also, I'm not sure how well this fits in this sub since it's really about an entire entitled family. If you know somewhere it would be better suited for, let me know. So... My fiancé (N) died very unexpectedly in 2016, at the age of 35. I was 26 at the time.We lived together in a house on a few acres; I'd lived there for a couple years, and he had lived there most of his life. N's grandfather built the house, and when his grandparents died, the house was willed to their six children, one of whom was N's mother. When N's mother died, her share was willed to N and his two siblings. So N was a partial owner of the home. His aunt, R, also lived there. She was mentally unstable in many ways I won't get into, except to say that she was a serious hoarder. Consequently, the house was in disrepair. (Honestly, it was not fit to be lived in and could've easily been condemned, but it was a rough time. Please spare your judgment if you can.) N and I were in the process of getting an apartment when he died.Since N and R were the only partial owners living there, they paid all the property taxes and for repairs, etc. (I contributed too after I moved in.) It's not like N and I were just squatting there or something. A couple months before N died, R had some health issues that resulted in her being hospitalized and then moving into an apartment. That's when the entitled family (N's aunts, uncles, and cousins) swooped in and started demanding that we move out so they could sell the property. Okay, fine. We were planning on moving anyway. They were really unrealistic about the timeline though. At one point they insisted that since we were low-income, all we needed to do was contact The Government^TM (they weren't sure what department), and they'd just give us a small house and some land. That's how out of touch with reality these people were. They'd just show up in the house whenever they wanted, which I guess legally was their right, but it's also pretty rude and entitled to just come into someone's home on a regular basis without even speaking to them while you're there, much less letting them know beforehand. Anyway, when N died, they were unabashedly **elated**.Two days after he died, I was at the house collecting some of my things when I got a text from his sister (who is an angel, so we'll call her AS) saying that they'd messaged his out-of-state uncle's wife, asking her to message AS about me because God forbid anyone be direct. Apparently they wanted me banned from the property immediately. We'd been "living in sin," and now that N was gone, I had no reason or right to be there. I was devastated. At that point I wanted to take everything he'd ever touched and scoop it up and hold it close to me forever. I couldn't bear the thought of not being able to have anything of his. As an afterthought, I realized all of MY stuff was also still there. Luckily, AS stuck up for me and said I could be there as long as I wanted. She lives across the country though, so she couldn't do much to enforce it. The most egregious display of disgusting entitlement/general assholeishness happened a couple days later. I was at the house, frantically trying to load up the car with the things that made up the life that N and I shared together, which was taxing both physically and emotionally. I was crying when N's cousin (EC) appeared in our bedroom. EC: *smiling like I'm an old friend she just ran into each other at Costco* HEY! Isn't this CRAZY? N died so suddenly! He was fine a few days ago! Me: *through tears* Yeah. It was very unexpected. EC: *laughing* I know! Well, at least we can sell this dump now. It's then that I hear people talking and laughing in the next room. Apparently EC had brought her teenage daughter and several of her daughter's friends to gawk at the house. Our home, where we lived and loved, was being openly mocked with zero regard for my feelings. EC: So when do you think you'll be gone? Me: I'm not sure. I'd like to get as much of N's stuff as possible, and AS asked me to get some of their mom's things.EC: *frowning* Well, I guess I'll have to talk to AS about that. Their mom is the reason this place is so run down, you know. *laughing again* I don't see why AS would want any of this garbage!(Note that this is blatantly false, as the house had been in pristine condition until N's mother died and R's hoarding worsened to the point that N could not keep up with it. Also, there were plenty of keepsakes and heirlooms that were not at all "garbage.")I'm sort of dumbfounded by this whole exchange and way too emotionally drained to deal with it, so I just get back to what I was doing. Later that night, EC's sister messaged me asking what I'd done with R's box of plastic horses. R wanted them back immediately. Of course, I had not taken it. Why would I want a box of plastic horses? (Hint: I would not.) I elected not to reply.After that, they got more aggressive about me not being there because a was a plastic horse theif. N was an artist by trade, and they started just throwing away all of his drawings and taking some of the more valuable figurines he had. The last day I was there, my mom went with me. After getting the last of what I could, I just wanted to walk around the house one last time and sort of say goodbye to the place we'd spent so much time together in, a place I'd never be again. Of course, the family showed up, and my mom tried to calmly explain that I would be out soon and would not return. She tried to appeal to their sense of humanity by explaining how traumatized I was from his death and how I just needed this for some semblance of closure, but his aunt got in her face and lectured her about how N was in hell and I'd be going there too. Then my mom, who somehow managed not to knock her teeth out, reminded her that AS had told me I could be there. The aunt responded by calling the police to have me forcibly removed. We left before the police arrived, and now that's my final memory of the place where the most amazing man I've ever known taught me how to love. I'm sorry it's a bit anticlimactic, but this really was cathartic for me to write. If you've read this far, I sincerely thank you! Edit: WOW! I posted this before work, and I come back to this outpouring of love and support. I wish I had time to reply to each and every comment, but just know that your condolences are very much appreciated. Also, thank you for my first silver and gold!! A couple things I want to clarify: I'm a woman. The "living in sin" comments were just about us living together before marriage. He died of either sepsis or a pulmonary embolism. The hospital said one thing, the ME said another. I appreciate everyone saying I may have had legal recourse, but at the time, my entire life and all my future plans had been ripped away from me. It was not worth spending the little energy I had to try to drag it out any further. His sister and brother were his legal next of kin, and he did not have a will. Since his sister told me to get all of his and their mom's things, I was never worried about them coming after me for stealing any of it. 
Edit: Conversion for temperature: 35 degrees celsius is  95 degrees Fahrenheit.&#x200B;A need to know detail: It was F\*\*\*\*N Hot. it was about 35 degrees (celsius) but it felt like 44. Important detail for later.&#x200B;So i was standing in line at the checkout at my local supermarket. I think in total I had about 10 items, some frozen goods, drinks and snacks. I usually tend to take out out one of the buds of my phone so in case someone adresses me, I would hear it.&#x200B;At this time, the woman at the cash register was taking care of the payment of one client and there was one person in front of me. and then suddenly she appeared, The Em in this story. Now honestly she didn't look it, she didn't even give off a mean vibe or anything. even the way she started talking to me was overall nice and polite, AT FIRST.&#x200B;"Excuse me, do you mind if I skip ahead, I'm in a hurry.". Now in general if somebody politely asks me this and I don't have any urgent business of my own, I usually don't mind. This time however, I didn't have that many groceries so her delay would be at most a few minutes, while she was pushing a fully loaded shopping cart in front of her. So if I would have let her skip, I'd propably still be in the store for another 10 - 20 minutes. So I politely decline and tell her I will hurry as much as I can.&#x200B;Offcourse this was a great offense, I had not given this woman her entitlement. she blew up instantly. yelling and screaming at me that she was in a hurry and (not kidding here) had to be home in time for her shows. Now at this time I would like to point out that during this rant she only said she had to be home in time for shows and that they were very important to her, there was nothing else making this urgent for her. This is important a bit later.&#x200B;Now while this woman was going off, the person at the cash register went into ignore mode and just started scanning my groceries, which I loaded into a bag while the EM was going on about how I was garbage and they should me ban me from the store .&#x200B;Now this should have been the end of it, just turn around and go home and forget this happened. but then she said something that 1. made me almost want to kill her 2. made this a postable story.&#x200B;While I was walking away, just about to put the earbud back in, she yells "if you pass by my car, tell my son he's the reason he has to wait another half an hour for me.". now I'm not an extremely smart person but in this moment my brain made some connections quickly.&#x200B;What I realized was this: 1. again it was very hot outside. 2. this woman had been in the store for a while (judging by the amount of groceries) 3. the entire parking lot of this store had almost no shade. 4. it was about 2PM (so the sun was just over it's peak).I rush outside and start running past cars, scanning them for kids inside. Thankfully, one the first cars I pass has a small child laying in the back seat. this kid is as pale as a ghost, sweating like crazy and it looked like he was only half conscious. I run back inside, and to my utter astonishment, this bitch is having a conversation with the cashier while she's checking out her groceries. I grab her by the shoulders, spin her around and yell almost straight to her face that her kid is literally dying in your car. and if you don't do something right now I'm smashing in your windows and calling the cops.&#x200B;At first she looked at me in complete confusion, probably never been spoken too like that before in her life. then the realization of what I told her sunk in and she rushed outside. while she went outside a man tapped me on the shoulder and asked what had happened. I explained the situation actually leaving out the bit at the cash register, just saying I saw the kid in the car and knew that this woman was probably the owner.&#x200B;He went outside and when I came outside, the Em suddenly rushed me and got I'm my face saying I was the reason she was in the store for so long and her son's current condition was my fault. Begore I can even respond, the man that approached me earlier speaks up. Turns out this man was an off duty cop and had been in the store for a while and as such knew that the actual delay caused by me could have not caused this. he also said he had already called an ambulance for the kid and the cops for her.&#x200B;I don't know what happened to the EM but she completely crashed. she just sat down on the pavement and started shaking her head, not saying much except the occasional sob or "not my fault"&#x200B;as for the ending: everything turned out okay for most parties. I stayed a while to give a statement to the cops and my contact info in case it went to court. the kid was okay (afterwards) and since his mom got arrested they called his dad or another male family member (I didn't ask) to accompany him to hospital.&#x200B;as for the EM, I'm assuming she is going to have to stand trail for child endangerment, not sure if she'll just get a fine or jail time.&#x200B;&#x200B;UPDATE: I was contacted by the police a few days ago (last Friday). I went to the station where they went over my statement, asked if I wanted to add or amend anything I said (I didn't). They couldn't really tell me directly what was going to happen with the mother or the family in general but said that the standard punishment (when the child is not seriously hurt or dead) is usually a GAS fine (GAS stands  for Gemeentelijke Administratieve Sanctie in dutch and  municipal administrative sanction in English). I think it's kind of sad something bad has to happen before serious punishment is handed out. I do not know what the amount of the fine will be but as for me it couldn't be high enough. I have not seen any of those people in the store or in the area in general but I also don't know if they live near here or were just passing by the store by coincidence. or maybe they are just avoiding the store, that's also possible. That will probably be the end of this tale, I know many of you hoped for something worse for the mother but sadly, life is not fair but at least the child lived and let's hope the mother learned a lesson.
You know the Deal: not my first language + im on mobile. So sorry in advance.It’s a short one:So im from Germany and we have some NS museums in different places to remind us of the horror and inform visitors of what happened in the specific area of Germany they’re visiting.I was visiting one when I heard a child cry. Not a baby that didn’t know better but a toddler. Sounded genuinely upset. Enter: Entitled mom. I hear her loudly complain about a video and how this isn’t child friendly at all. Now first of all in these museums it’s fucking quiet. Second of all they are not supposed to be child friendly. They show raw horrible pictures that show a brutal truth and most adults are left speachless. It can turn your stomach sometimes. Employee: I’m really sorry it upset her... This museum is suggested for ages 14 and up.EM: How is she supposed to LEARN?! Now that kid was three max. You can maybe talk to them about it, but these museums are clearly not for kids, it even says so on the website. Now I’m already invested in this when mom goes on about how they should have censored „that“. I turn around to see what they talk about and my heart sinks. It’s a video of piles of dead, starved, naked bodies they found in concentration camps. It’s a horrifying thing to look at. And this lady complained about some genetalia being shown?! I’m pretty sure the kid was crying about the overall visual and not some dicks. The employee looked shooked and she has clearly never heard that complain before. She confusedly offered to refund their tickets and the lady angrily agreed. Some people...EDIT: Damn guys, thank you so so much for my first reddit gold, I can't believe it!!!
Right, so this happened about 5 years ago when I was working as a newly qualified social worker (I know, lynch mob me, I don’t anymore it was a nightmare).It has been a rough morning and long story short, I had spit and vomit on me. As pretty standard practice, I kept a spare set of court clothes in my car so I had something to change into, but I felt pretty disgusting and wanted a shower. So I took an early lunch and went to my gym nearby the office to shower and change. I showered, came out and put my hair up into a towel turban and walked to go back to the lockers. Changing area was empty except for one kid, a boy about 8/9. A bit weird for him to be alone, but I assumed his mum must’ve been in the only occupied stall so I didn’t think too much of it. I smiled to acknowledge him, and got to my locker to grab my things to change into. At this point, the boy (EK) looked at me, pointed at my towel turban and said:‘What’s that?’ Me: Oh it’s a towel turban, pretty neat huh? It stays up better than a regular towel.Ek: Cool.And started to reach for my head.Me: Excuse me, what are you doing?EK: I just want to see itMe: Err, no I’m using it, sorry.At this point in my life, I’m pretty used to kids being a bit inappropriate, and it’s my job to make sure they understand, but I wasn’t expecting here. He looked a bit pissed, but went back to his (mum’s?) phone.I get dressed quickly and get my things to go over to the mirror and take the turban off to hairdryer my hair. I’m flipping my hair around to get it dried and I notice that this kid comes up to the mirror, then leaves again. I think nothing of it, and finish drying my hair, turn the hairdryer off, reach for my turban... and it isn’t there. I know what he’s done, and I whip around and look at him and he’s turning a shade of red but staring fixedly on his phone so as to ignore me. I’m trying to remain calm, but Christ I’ve been spat at, vomited on and now someone has stolen my towel turban?! I walk back over and do my best ‘I’ve had enough of this bullshittery’ voice and say‘Please return the turban. Now.’He keeps ignoring me, so I repeat‘Please return the turban. Now.’He’s gone a huge shade of red, refuses to look at me and mumbles something like ‘I didn’t take it’.I’ve had it at this point, so go over to the only occupied stall and knock on the door‘Excuse me, is this your son out here?’EM opens the door and looks at me throughly annoyed.EM: what?Me: is this your son? He has taken my towel turban, I have asked for it back, but he is not returning it. Please ask him to hand it back, and I’ll not inform the gym staff.EM: what the fuck is a towel turban?I start to explain, but EK says‘It’s a hair towel that stays up better than a normal towel!’We both look at him, and she saysEM: Ok... so what do you want?Me: I want my towel turban back please. EM: well, he wouldn’t just take something, you obviously just lost it. You shouldn’t go around accusing people because you lose things!Me: (getting annoyed) well, he will have no problem then emptying his bag. If he has it, he can just hand it back and if I’m mistaken, I will apologise. EM looks at EK and it’s obvious to anyone that he’s lying, but she just saysEM: Don’t be fucking stupid, I’m not letting you rummage through his things like he’s some kind of thief! Look at you, you are harassing a little boy in a changing room!I inhale to try and stop my eyes doing a 360 degree roll, and sayMe: I’m not asking to touch anything. I’m asking for you to go through his bag for my turban. That is all. If you are not willing, I will go to the staff and ask them to sort this out. (I know it’s just a freaking towel turban, but theft is theft, and it’s pink and cute, so I’m not letting anyone have it)EM: so you’re threatening me now?!I know a circular argument when I hear one, so I go to the door, lean out and call for someone to come and sort it out. Enter gym trainer dude (gtd).GTD: What’s going on?He looks between the three of us and the kid has gone back to staring a hole through the phone and EM positions herself between GTD and EK. EM: This crazy bitch is harassing my son and trying to go through his bag! She needs throwing out! She...Me: That isn’t what happened. Her son has taken my towel turban, and I would like it returned. I just keep looking at this kid, and GTD saysGTD: Ok, so what happened mate? Did you take the towel? EK mumbles something about how I must’ve lost it and EM jumps in and saysEM: See? He didn’t take it, he’s so traumatised he can barely say anything!She then bends down to him and hugs him saying ‘it’ll be alright’ and she ‘won’t let me get away with this’ verrrrrrry dramatically. I look at GTD and explain the whole event and he says GTD: Ok, so, why don’t we just check his bag?EK starts dramatically wailing and EM starts ranting about how this is harassment. GTD looks uncomfortable and says ‘that’s literally the only way I think I can solve this’. EM then stands up and tries to push past me, but I’m not moving and the room is small so fails. She starts swearing and thrusts the kids backpack at GTD sayingGM: Fine! Check it! He hasn’t taken it, and when you don’t find it, I want her thrown out! You to apologise and get the manager!EK wails. GTD obviously finds the pink, wet turban towel in the bag. He picks it up and kinda just looks at it. EK wails even more and tries to grab it, but GTD holds it out of his reach. GTD: Right, so... so... this is yours?Me: yes, thank you. I stuff the ‘coveted’ turban towel into my bag and get out my cars keys and ID lanyard. As I put the lanyard over my head, something audibly clicked in EM’s head: that’s a social worker ID. She yanks EK’s arm, snatches the bag from GTD, and I move to let her pass. GTD looks super confused and I explain that she must’ve just been embarrassed that her son stole my turban. But I knew she was panicking because she realised what my job was and that her son was out of school stealing pink wet turban towels.  
My boyfriend's cousin (his [paternal uncle's](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/cbkd4t/my_boyfriend_takes_very_good_care_of_himself_and/) daughter) has 4 children. Each of her kids is the personification of the word 'bratty'. The said cousin refuses to discipline them and constantly makes excuses for their behavior. She's also very  judgemental of our decision to not have children. She has often made some snide comments towards me, implying that I'm the selfish cunt who is depriving my bf of the "joys of raising children". For these reasons and for her generally entitled behavior, my boyfriend had cut ties with her.&#x200B;However, when he and I visited his parental home three days ago for his parent's anniversary celebration, we ran into her again.  My boyfriend's dad had urged him to use this occasion to mend bridges with the cousin. So we both tried to make nice and engaged in small talk with her. During our conversation, bf mentioned that we were leaving for Melbourne for vacation in a few days.&#x200B;&#x200B;At this, cousin's eyes lit up. "Oh that sounds like so much fun" she said, "My husband and I haven't gone anywhere since our honeymoon." She whined some more about how hard it is for them with 4 kids, if only they could afford such luxuries  etc etc etc.  I could tell where this was going. My boyfriend probably felt sorry for her and, being the kind and generous soul that he is, offered to buy them a weekend in a resort in Mt. Abu (a hill station in the Indian state of Rajasthan).&#x200B;Cousin (face scrunched up) : "That's nice, but why can't you just take us to Melbourne with you?"&#x200B;BF (getting a bit annoyed, but still patient) : Well, we want to spend some time alone together. Plus we'll be meeting some close friends there. Besides, Mt Abu is a beautiful place. Your kids will love it.&#x200B;Cousin (in the annoying 'Karen' tone) : I still don't see why you can't take us to Australia. You're being so selfish, going on this great trip and sticking your family with a cheap weekend getaway.&#x200B;BF's Mom : \[Cousin's name\] He's making a very generous offer. Either take it or leave it.&#x200B;Cousin (wearing the expression that morons wear when they think they've had a bright idea) : Oh I know! Why don't my husband and I go to Mt Abu and you can take our kids to Melbourne.&#x200B;Me : What ???&#x200B;Cousin : It's a great idea. The kids can have fun in Melbourne with you two and my hubby and I can enjoy a  peaceful weekend. This way the kids can actually spend some time with their uncle. You never make time for them!&#x200B;BF : I'm offering for the last time. It's either the weekend in Mt Abu or nothing at all. And why the hell would we ruin *our* vacation taking care of your *kids?*&#x200B;Cousin : How can you say that? My kids are so well behaved. You'll have so much fun spending time with them. Besides, my husband and I could really use some quite time together.  You and shygirlturnedsassy don't have any responsibilities. You have no idea how hard it is ti raise 4 kids. You can afford this trip. I don't see why you won't share with family......&#x200B;BF : One more word and you're loosing my Mt Abu offer.&#x200B;On hearing this the cousin STFU. We all had dinner together and she was mercifully quite. If only her kids had followed her example.&#x200B;You'd think this would be the end of it , but NO! We had seriously underestimated her dedication to her Karenness. This morning, cousin showed up at my apartment with the kids in tow. I was shocked to see her of course and asked if something was wrong. She smiled and said "I'm just here to drop the kids off. You're leaving tonight right?"&#x200B;After taking a second to recover from the shock I asked " Did you fall and hit your head on something? We told you we weren't taking your kids with us. What part of that did you not understand.&#x200B;She then tried to convince me that my bf had called her later on and had agreed to take her kids. I knew this was bullshit and called it as such.&#x200B;Cousin became enraged and asked if I was going to break her kids' heart, why would I break our promise and how bf and I could be so cold. I called my bf and after telling him what was going on I turned on the speaker.&#x200B;My boyfriend proceeded to chew her out  brutally, telling her she he would no longer pay for their weekend getaway and that this is exactly the kind of behavior that had made him cut ties with her . She tried to get a word in but he wouldn't let her.&#x200B;Cousin took her kids and stormed off. Bf and I are having a laugh over this and are still wondering what made her think that this plan would ever work.
Hey y'all, coming at ya with a lil tale from my encounter with an EM this morning. Characters are just EM, her son, and yours truly. TL;DR at the bottom. Not really NSFW but some mention of mother nature's red river and associated body parts so if that bothers you, you were warned.So I'm in the middle of my monthly visit from mama nature and I realised that I was all out of sanitary products. I stopped off at my local supermarket before I commuted to uni so I could stock up, and decided to treat myself to a meal deal so I wouldn't have to eat overpriced campus food later (Not to brag or anything but I got the sickest sandwich). Paid and left, all normal, right?I decided not to get a carrier bag (save the turtles!!!) but definitely overestimated my ability to carry. Of course I had no pockets, cos womens clothes don't fucking have any, so I find myself juggling my phone, wallet, car keys, sandwich, cereal bar, bottled water, and tampons in just my two small hands. And of course I'd parked far, far away from the doors so as to minimise interacting with people, standard.So I'm doing this awkward half-walk-half-jog back to my car and focusing really, really hard on not dropping my sandwich, so I don't immediately see the EM and her small child walking near me. When I do see them it's because I'm almost walking into them. The conversation goes like this:Me: oh hey I'm so sorry, I didn't see you there!!EM: It's fine, no worr-Her beady lil eyes clock onto my hands and she stops mid sentence. She just... Stares. At my hands. Now my sandwich *did* look good so I can't say I blamed her for looking at first. But I was a little weirded out. I give her a couple seconds to find her voice, realise she's not going to continue, and politely carry on my voyage to my vehicle. I don't really look at EM and her son but I guess at some point they start walking again, in the same direction as me. What do you know, they're the proud owners of the only other car in my carefully-selected deserted car park corner, parked a few spaces down from me.EM: hey!! Hey you!!Me: ...hi?EM: you shouldn't wave those around you know! There's boys here!Me: what?EM: those... Things you're holding! They're personal items! Get a carrier bag!I look down and finally realise she's referring to my tampons. Now, maybe it's just me but I don't really see an issue with carrying my shopping to my car without a bag, even if my shopping is sanitary products. They aren't exactly dirty mags, are they? And I have needs. I kinda just brush it off and carry on. I hear her say something else with a huff but couldn't make out the words so I just carried on with my morning.Now, I get to my car and realise my dilemma. Hands full + locked car = struggle. Being the bulkiest thing I'm holding, I put the tampon box on the roof of my car so I have some room to manoeuvre my keys and get my car door open. I'm merrily doing so when I feel a presence beside me, and then a scrawny clawed arm reaches over my shoulder and snatches my tampons from where they lay. I turn around and there she is, looking absolutely livid.Me: what the fuck are you doing?EM: how dare you? I told you once already! These shouldn't be flaunted around! I have my son right here with me and he doesn't need to see that!Me: see what, exactly? A cardboard box?EM: you know what! These are intimate products, and there are children here!At this point she shoves the box back into my hands.EM: now put them away where they belong!Her son, who cant be more than 6, starts to tug at her.Son: mummy let's go! I have school!EM: yeah baby we're going now, I was just chatting to this lady.Me: chatting? You just screamed in my face and assaulted me over some tampons! (edit to clarify: I used the word assault in a slightly dramatic sense/a verbal assault context, cos I thought it would make her back off. She didn't actually touch me or anything.)Son: what are tampons?EM gave a little shriek, and grabbed her darling son protectively before fixing me with a glare.EM: see what you did??????Me: whatever lady, I'm leaving.I get into my car fully ready to drive away, but EM just stayed stood and looking at me as if I just kicked a puppy or 7. Something about it really ticked me off, so I wound my window down and just as I pulled away, gave her a cheery wave of the tampon box and a smile.Me: Off to stuff these up my vagina!!The screeching was unintelligible over the sound of my engine, but I didn't need to hear the words to know the vibe of what she said.TL;DR: I sully a child's innocence by daring to carry a tampon box around in public. His mother accosts me and gives me a telling off in a car park for waving them around.EDIT: holy shit????????? I've never posted anything that's got this much love before. I've also never been awarded before. Thank y'all so so so much!!! 
My daughter's friend from school came home with her one day. They were doing girlie stuff that normal 14yr olds do (makeup, nails, ECT). I hear a blood curdling scream and run upstairs expecting the worst. I open the bathroom door and the girl is on the toilet with blood on her toilet paper. I was like... Ok, she started her period. Nothing too crazy.My daughter and I sit her down and I explain why we have periods and what that means for her from now on. We hug her and congratulate her on this next step of her life. Afterwards, we go get her supplies from the store and grab ice cream. She is all calmed down and feeling special at this point. I took her home and thought it was strange her parents never mentioned anything to get about any of this. She was 14 after all.About an hour later I receive a call from her vivid mother who berates me for have the odacity to tell her daughter about those private things and that she will learn things on her own just like she, the mom, had to. I was completely stunned! She had no intention of explaining anything to her daughter. She then said the girls couldn't be friends anymore. Her daughter would still come over without the parents knowing and still calls me to this day (6yrs later) for guidance in her life.
Ok a bit to start with. I'm a freelance hiking and snowmobile guide on the island of Svalbard (Norwegian Arctic) and have to deal with all sorts of people on a day to day base. I'm not super sure if this guy still qualifies as an Entitled Dad, since his Son must have been at least 40, but here we go. A few months ago I was guiding a trip by myself, we only send one guide out, when the group is small, so I went to the hotels to pick up my guests - an Italian couple and this Saudi Arabian Father (ED) Son (S) combo.   I walked into their hotel, introduced myself and got everybody to sit in the car, when ED opened the passenger seat door, sat down and looked at me confused:ED: Oh Sorry! This is your seat, right?Me: No you can sit there if you want, it's easier to drive from the other side anyway. (I always try to crack a joke or two, to break the ice - lots of people are nervous when having to drive a snowmobile the first time)He looked at me slightly more confused, but I assumed it's only a language thing. Brought them back to HQ and gave them a full safety briefing and overview on a map on where we'd be going. After that I got them dressed and told them to wait outside, because our suits are made to keep you warm at -30C, so inside a building you quickly start to melt. Once I was dressed I went to meet them outside.ED: Oh? You're coming with us on the tour?Me: I hope so, since I'm your guide (I had told them in the briefing the usual "Hey, my name is Kat and I'll be your guide for today")ED: Is that a gun?Me: Yes, Sir. But don't worry, she's not yet loaded.ED and S looked at each other confused, and we all started walking towards the snowmobiles so I could give them a small briefing on how to drive them.The Italians had told me, they have been driving before, so I decided to place them in the end of the group and ED and S in the front (everybody got to drive their own vehicle), because out of experience it's always better for the more experienced guests to be in the back, since they might have to speed up here and there to fill a gap.ED: But where is the guide?Me: Here. I'm just in front of you. A proud 1.77m, had to miss.ED: But you're female. Guides can't be female!Me: Hm? About 50% of our guides are girls here on Svalbard, it's not that uncommon. Don't worry we girls are just as good as our male colleagues. S: I think my father wants to know, who will operate the gun.Me: Well let's hope we don't even have to take it out of the boot, but if we have, I am trained and licensed to shoot. S: No.Me: No?S: You are a woman! Woman can't shoot guns!ED: It's not safe!Me: Excuse me? Guys if you don't want me as your guide, that's fine with me. Go back into HQ, take the suit off and tell our receptionist to call you a taxi. If you don't feel safe, that's up to you, but I am the guide for this trip today and if you want to head out, you'll have to deal with me.ED: But if we don't go, we want our money back!Me: You can try, but I bet you, that you won't get a penny because it's your own decision to not come along. S: I will go, if you get a male guide for us.Me: I won't get anybody else to join. You've signed the agreement, that I'm in charge of this tour and you will listen to what I tell you to do and not to do.ED: I didn't sign anything.Me: Yes, about 15 minutes ago, before you got dressed. I saw you sign it.ED then walks off back into HQ, S and the Italians stayed. S called his dad, found out ED would not come with a woman. S and the Italians drove with me, we saw reindeer, sea ice, a polar bear in the distance (no need for the riffle) and in general had a great time. After the tour S came to me to apologize for his behavior and called me a "good girl guide", my boss heard that and still mocks me with it today =)&#x200B;TL:DR Father and Son think "females" can't be guides, ED storms off and Son has to admit that I know my job. Edit: thank you for all the amazing comments, I'm slowly working my way through reading them all, didn't think I'd get that much attention. Stay safe, stay curious and stay happy you wonderful people.
This happened earlier today, so it’s about as fresh as the glasses of strawberry milk that appear in our fridge every once in awhile and nobody takes responsibility for.So I was out at the grocery store questioning the amount of mini pizzas that I can get and still be able to fit them in the freezer when I heard rolling behind me. Not a big deal until I turned around and realized my cart was gone. I saw someone pushing a cart down at the end of the aisle, I ran up to them, but unfortunately they weren’t the Entitled Mom (from this point on her name will be Carol).I go looking around for my cart but can’t find it because Carol pulled a Get Out Fast, but eventually security comes to up to me and asks me to come to the front of the store with them. I go, and there I find Carol with my cart, and her baby sitting in it.  Carol: That’s the man that tried to kidnap my baby!Security: Sir, what happened between you and Carol?Me: I’ve never met her, the only thing I can think of is that while my back was turned someone took my cart and my drink was in the cupholder (it was still there, had my name on it and everything)Security: Can you show your ID?I showed the guard my ID, matched up with my appearance and the name on the cup.Security began talking to Carol when I got a text from my husband, it was a meme, nothing important. Carol noticed this, and the fact that my phone screen was cracked. It isn’t a big crack, but it’s around the middle (dropped my phone on chopsticks while out to eat).Carol: That’s my phone! He broke it so I’ll cut my finger when I use it! He’s trying to hurt me, arrest him for assault!I’ve gotten cuts from cracked screens but they’re really just papercuts that bleed and don’t hurt as much. Legos have drawn more of my blood than cracked screens over my life, and I only replace cracked screens when I get a new phone or my husband insists on it. Cracked screens usually are not that dangerous, and mine certainly isn’t.Me: Ma’am this is my phone, it’s been broken for months and it maybe cut me once. Carol: Prove it!Knowing she’ll say I changed the passcode, I opened my photos app and gave it to the security guard with a quick warning about the content of some of the photos.Security: What Type Of photos do you have on here?Carol: Pictures of my family and kids!Security: Do you have anything that could be considered inappropriate?Carol: Of course not!Security: Then why are there nude photos of OP from months ago on here?Carol: He put them on there!Security: No, these were put onto this phone months ago.Carol: THATS A LIE!Carol then tries to grab Security Guy by the shirt, but gets restrained. I’m given my cart back (without her baby) and she gets banned from the store.
Hello again, I decided today is a good day to tell a story about the ED that turned my whole life upside down, so lets get on with this.This happened 6 years ago, it was a week after my birthday and we decided to throw a late birthday party, my parents were busy with work on my actual birthday so we rescheduled the party.I invited quite a few of my friends, but one of them didn't seem to show up, his father called my parents saying he'd be late to the party. (the party was from 7:00pm to 12:00am)He never showed up.once the party was over, we were heading home (were about 5 or 10 minutes from Oslo, cause we had the party at our lodge just outside the city) and talking about how fun the party was.That conversation was cut short when a vehicle drifted into our lane and collided with us, I blacked out.when I woke up in a hospital bed, I started to panic, but the doctor that was running tests on me to make sure I'm okay told me to calm down and that I was alright.After about 20 to 30 minutes of questioning and small tests, I asked the big question.Me: Sir? *Where are my parents?*The doctor basically froze there for 10 second and responded, and I'll never forget what he told me.D: *OP, I'm so sorry but... your parents didn't survive the crash.*My parents were deceased, I was informed that my dad was killed on Impact, and my mom was pronounced dead when she arrived at the hospital with me.I couldn't believe it, I wanted to cry, but all I felt was anger, I knew the person whom drifted into my lane was at fault, so I asked who crashed into us.It was My friend dad, the god damn ED.Apparently ED was under the influence of something when he arrived and id currently handcuffed to a hospital bed. One of the nurses told me later that he was demanding help before his son would be treated, his son that was on god damn life support because of the accident!!He was sent to jail for a DUI and I don't know if he's been released or not, but if he's out there he better hope we don't cross paths.I'm currently living in a foster home with a wonderful family who treat me like I'm there own flesh and blood, but as long as I'm alive, I'll never forget my real parents, and I'll never forget my best friend, and I'll never forgive ED for what he's done.Thank you for listening...&#x200B;Edit: Thank you all for the positive support, I really appreciate it. The awards aren't necessary, but thank you anyways.For all of you wondering, my friend did pass away 3 days after the accident, and I don't know if the father has been charged with more than DUI but there is a high probability that he was charged with manslaughter.And yes I do hope he's still rotting in a jail cell, he shouldn't be allowed to walk the streets. (If he is at all)For all the people asking why he's entitled, he was demanding help from the nurses before his son, I have more stories about his entitlement before the accident, but I'll save those for another time.
Got another airport story for you, Reddit. Sorry for formatting issues, I’m on mobile.S: Sister EK: Entitled Kid EM: Entitled Mom Me: Chuck NorrisSo my sister and her husband flew up to come visit the family in Canada and introduce their newborn daughter to everyone over the Easter weekend. It wasn’t a long visit, and they went to the airport this morning to check in for their flight. My train back to my apartment didn’t leave for another 3 hours, so I tagged along to help with stroller and bags. Basically I was an extra pair of hands so they could focus more on the baby instead of trying to juggle bags and everything.So we’re standing in line (there was an issue at the check in kiosk), and I feel my small rolling weekend bag get extremely heavy all of a sudden, to the point where it almost yanks right out of my grip. I turn around and there’s a girl, anywhere from 7-10 years old, sitting on my bag.Me: Excuse me, please get off my bag.EK: My feet hurt and I wanna sit down! She then bounced in place and actually yanked the bag handle out of my grip, causing both it and EK to fall to the ground. EM: Don’t drop my child like that!Me: She was sitting on my bag and yanked it out of my grip.It’s barely 6:30am at this point, and I had zero patience for this stupidity, so I just hold my bag in my hand, out of the way for EK to sit on. My niece starts getting fussy (as young babies will), and my brother in law jogs off to go grab a bottle of water to make her a bottle. They thought they would be through security at this point, so they weren’t prepared to make her a bottle. No big deal, I tell my sister to take care of her baby and I’ll manage the bags. But behind me, EK was just getting started.EK: Mooooooooommmmyyyyyyyyyy, my feet huuuuuuurt and I wanna siiiiiiiiiiiit. (I shit you not, this kid dragged out her words exactly like this.)EM: Hang on sweetie.My sister was adjusting the baby in her stroller in an attempt to calm her down, but from behind her it looked like she was taking the baby out.EM: See, she’s taking the baby out of the stroller, go sit there.My sister hears this, and she just about loses her mind.S: Uh, no, she can’t sit here.EM: You’re taking the kid out, she can sit there!S: No I’m not, and no she can’t. She’s a grown ass child, she can stand like the rest of us.EM: Her feet hurt. Take your brat out of the stroller and let her sit there.My sister gets this look on her face that I know very well, it pretty much promises that she’s going to fuck up your day.S: OP, take <Baby’s Name> out of the stroller please. <Brother in Law> should be here with the water for her bottle in a minute. I get confused, but I trust her and take the baby out of the stroller. EM gets this look of absolute triumph, only for it to drop off her face as my sister then grabs my weekend bag and the diaper bag and put them right where the baby was sitting.S: Like I said, bitch, your child is grown, and she can stand. My child is 9 weeks old. She can barely hold her head up on her own. You need to get some fucking sense in your head.At this point in time a check in attendant has noticed my sister’s situation with the baby, who was still fussing, and pulled her to the front of the line to get her through. Brother in law reappears right after that to help sort out bags while I feed the baby. I looked for EM and EK, and EK was on the ground throwing a massive temper tantrum, worse than any tantrum I’ve seen in children half her age. EM just looked like she was sucking on a lemon.TL;DR: EK sits on my bag while I’m holding it, complaining of sore feet and being tired. They fall off, EM then demands for my sister to take her newborn out of the stroller for the EK to sit in it. My sister blatantly refuses, and the kid throws a temper tantrum.Edit: SpellingEdit 2: Thanks so much for the silver and gold awards!Edit 3: Huge thanks for the Platinum!
Non-english speaker, on mobile, bare with me on this.So I've seated a few rows behind a family of four and the boarding is nearly complete.Family daughter (entitled kid) is sobbing, and it gets more and more audible as more people get in and on their seats.Finally Entitled Mother gets a hold of the flight attendant and demands her to ask the captain "one more time" if they could have their dog in the cabin instead of the pet compartment.The flight attendant tries to explain that their dog is too large and has to travel in a separately.This provokes the entitled kid to cry out even louder, and the flight attendant tries to explain how it is perfectly safe for animals to travel in their designated compartment underneath the passengers.The fuss starts to attract attention, and someone close to my row announces their severe allergy to dogs to the family and the flight attendant.The EM raises her voice and demands the flight attendant to dig their luggage and dog out of the plane, as they will find another airline that allows all family members in the cabin.At this point the plane is full and doors are closed, and it seems the captain is waiting for confirmation from the crew to start rolling towards the take-off strip.The flight attendant tries to explain how they would have to go through all the luggage to find theirs, and how that would delay the flight.EM is having none of it and very clearly articulates "you would turn back in an instant and go through it all if there was a bomb, wouldn't you?"All movement and chatter stops, and the flight attendant goes very serious. "Please remain seated, we'll see what we can do"It takes less than a minute for the police to arrive and escort the family out, ten more to get their luggage and the dog and another five for the flight to take off.Seeing the mad-angry husband with the crying kids watch their mom put in the police car was the best start for a holiday I've had in a long time.
So today husband and I were feeling bored and adventurous and decided to make a pilgrimage to a posh "Coffee Bar" in our city. We've been meaning to go for months but never got around to it. We pull in the lot and it's packed. 10:45am on a Sunday, so we expected it. As I'm getting out of the car the mombie next to me is struggling to get 3 kids out of their seats while her husband (?) stood by the front of the car watching. Not helping. I hop out and excuse myself and walk into the café with husband. Huge line. Two more people come in after us, then mombie and her horde. She immediately starts bitching about the line. She complains loudly to her husband at first, but when he's clearly ignoring her, she decides to just complain to thin air. "Why is this line always so long? God why don't they have more staff? Why does every fucking person have to come at the same damn time? UGH!" She eventually asked the couple in front of her if she can go ahead because her kids are really, really hungry (insert guilting sad face here.) These saints begrudgingly say sure, so now they're directly behind husband and I. She then says to me "Excuse me miss? May we have the spot before you in line? My children have been waiting a long time and are very hungry." With the nicest voice I could find, I said "I'm sorry ma'am, we've been waiting awhile too and are also hungry. The line is moving faster now at least!" I gave her a smile even though she was glaring at me. I turn back around only to hear her mutter "Wow what a bitch. Can you believe some people? How rude." It took all my effort to not react. Husband is a conflict avoider, I am not. But I respect his wishes enough to not cause a scene in public when I'm with him. Eventually she starts telling her husband how they're always out of the Mediterranean Spinach Breakfast sandwich she wants and she better get it this time or she's gonna be pissed. This is when I concoct a seriously evil plan. I check my watch; it's 10:55.A minute or two later, it's our turn. Husband orders his Soy Chai and I sloooowly order my vanilla nitro cold brew...with cream....no, not cream, sorry, with soy. And an extra pump of vanilla. Barista rings us up as I check my watch. It's 10:58. I ask to add a Mediterranean Spinach Breakfast Sandwich to the order. She says sure, no problem. Gives us the total. I'm digging in my purse for my wallet, darn, just can't seem to find it. More digging. Oh! There it is, finally. Hand her the card, wait for receipt, and slowly sign. Pack purse back up, say thank you and walk away.Husband says "You're hungry? We ate breakfast an hour ago." Me: "No, I'm not hungry. Just had to do this." Him: "Do what?"I nod towards mombie. Husband looks over. She orders her coffee and some juice things for kids, doesn't even ask if her husband wants anything. Then it happened. "And one Mediterranean Spinach Breakfast Sandwich."Barista: "Oh I'm sorry ma'am, we stopped serving breakfast at 11. We have all our lunch options today though."Mombie looks at her watch and yells "WHAT? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!? IT'S 11:02!" Barista: "I'm sorry ma'am, company policy is to stop breakfast at 11. Is there anything else I can get you?" Mombie: "GET ME YOUR MANAGER! THIS IS RIDICULOUS. YOU JUST SOLD ONE A MOMENT AGO! THIS IS ABSURD!"Manager came over; explained situation, apologized, but refused give that bitch a sandwich, bless her heart. Mombie retracts entire order and stomps out, red-faced and yelling to her car. My husband was trying to hold back his laughter.Our order came up. We grabbed it and went back to the car. I'm unwrapping the sandwich and take a bite exactly as I'm trying to scoot around her trying to strap her kids in again and say "Oh excuse me ma'am, just gonna sneak by ya real quick!" (Ah the Midwest.) She's fucking glaring at me, the worst death stare I've ever gotten. I get in the car and unwind the windows ever so slightly. It's hot today, right? I slowly unwrap the rest of the sandwich and take a few more bites, passing it to husband and back while she's screaming and struggling with her kids, getting no help from Daddict. As soon as she pulled away we burst into laughter.Today was a good day.
So when I was small I was included in a car accident which damaged my eyesight and looks of my eye itself. It's not really a lazy eye as my pupil just lazily rolls around my eye most of the time. (Some nerve thing, doctors say.). My mother hosted a great party with grills and everything and invited all her friends from the neighborhood, innocent right? Well.. not really.So I was eating with my friend when a little kid comes to our table, it was a cute little girl that said that she was lost, so I lowered myself to her level to ask about her mom so we can find her but as I did, she ran off while crying. I shrugged it off, there was alot of parents that are more experienced, this is where the fun begins.EM and her daughter approached me when I was taking another burger that my mom made, she took a look at me and then did an obviously disgusted sound. Then she said;EM: What is that?Me: What is what, ma'am?EM: What's with your eye, no wonder it made my daughter cry!Me: Wha-EM: Can't you at least hold it up?!Me: Do I look like I can?!EM: Don't raise your voice, young lady! You do not belong to this party anyways.Me: Why?!EM: You scare kids!At this time, people hear us and my mom storms in, furious. She explained everything and sends the entitled parent away, EM swears on my mom before going off..I love my mom.
As per usual, im on mobile and english is not my first language.Cast:Em: you guessed itEk: little shitstainBf: my guardian angelBw: bartenderOg: other guestsMe: i have the high groundAs I have told in my previous posts, im a femboy. Wich means that im a man that acts more feminine and in most occasions wear womens clothing and such. For those who dont know what it meant.I also told how my bf and I love to have date nights and such, this time we decided to go on a vacation, we took a small cruise. All this is relevant for later.My bf and I drove from our appartement early morning since we live quite some time from the harbor where we were going to sail from. It takes about 3-4 hours to drive. I am totally not a morning person, but my bf was completely gone that morning from work, so I decided to drive so he could sleep some more.We got there about 30 min before departure so we parked the car and went out to smoke. I was ready to drop, i was that exhausted since i work as well and was so excited about our trip that i didnt get much sleep that night. But we finished our cigarettes and got our bags and walked over to the check in.Enter the witch and her little shitstain:Em: move over, my son and I NEED to check in right now.We moved over since it wasnt our first encounter with an EM.She finished checking in her son and herself so we got back to the counter and finished up as well all the while we talked with the woman behind the counter about Ep's. We got aboard and went looking for our cabin. It had a nice double bed, big tv on the wall, a nice view etc. We packed out our luggage and settled in. We turned on the tv and watched Smokey and the bandit while waiting for the announcement that we were departing.When it came, we went up to the adult zone (one of the upper deck next to the bar) and who do we see, yup EM and ek. Ek cant have been older than 9, and this zone was only allowed for people 18 and older. (Im 19 turning 20, and bf is 23)We stood there remaking our own Jack and Rose from titanic. Em comes over.Em:you shouldnt act like that here, my son is here watching the Two of you. But you did well kid, having a cute gf like that. And Nice dress btw.I was wearing something like the lace up tartan assymetrical dress since i like the punk-ish style. We just thanked her and went back inside to rest a bit. In the evening we had a reservation at the more finer restaurant onboard. We got there and since we had a reservation we could skip the humoungus line. Some people didnt like it but stayed quiet, but not Her.Em: why do they get to skip the line while the rest of us has to stay behind? Let Me trade with you, my son is very hungry.I got tired of meeting her everywhere but hey, its a ship, surrounded by water, we cant avoid her for long.We got our table, still hearing em yelling at the workers. We ordered some wine and food, we ordered some fine food that i cant even spell the name of. My bf told Me that he had something to ask me. He took his chair and pushed it out so he could stand, eyed the waiter that came over with a little black box, i knew what was happening and started getting tears in my eyes. I had been waiting for some time for this to happen. He got on one knee and asked will you OP make me the happiest man on earth. He barely finished the sentence when i said yes, no time to think i just did it, i cant think of a life without him. Everyone started clapping and I gave him a long kiss. The em finally got through the line and saw us kissing.Em: cant you kiss your gf somewhere else, my son is with me.Bf: first of all, i just proposed and kissed to make it official. Second, that is not my gf, thats my bf.You could see all colour disappear from her face.Em: how... How could you do that with children present? You faggots should not do something like that at all. Blah, Blah, Blah.While she kept yelling i noticed that something smelled like shit and I couldnt see the little bastard anywhere, until....I looked down and there he was, trying to pull down my skirt to irritate or something. I quickly grabbed his hands and yanked him away from me. Remember how i said it smelled like shit? Well... It really hit the fan.Em: HOWDAREYOUTOUCHMYBABYLike that, yes. I dont think she breathed at all during that sentence.And here we go...Em:i will sue you for this you faggot. And stop wearing Girls clothing, it is not ok to walk like that.And all the usual homophobic stuff.My bf was furious. He normally never lays a hand on anyone, but had i not seen it and stopped him, he would have slapped her into the next century.The woman saw what he was about to do and acted like he actually did it.... with the employees and the Og looking at her. She got escorted out and we got our meal on the house.After '' resting" in our cabin, we set out to find the bar. We heard there was live music and good drinks so we had to try it.We found it after wandering around for a while. We entered, ordered some beer and sat down. We drank quite a bit and decided to dance as fiancees. And Who brought the storm during my waltz.Em: STOOOOOP THE Music.IT got quiet.Em: dont start the music until These Two faggots leave.She starts to sound like that typical homophobic priest while pointing at us all angry. The Og's looks at us and start debating what kind of bitch she was.Enter BW:Bw: miss, i have to ask you to leave the barEm: why do we have to leave while These Two get to stay?Bw: first of all, you brought a kid that most certainly is not 18 y/o or older. Second, we do not tolerate homophobic abuse. And last, youre just a nasty person.You could almost hear her jaw drop to the floor as she looked for a response. She ended up leaving, music started playing again and we gave an extra big tip before leaving to our cabin for some cozy time.The rest of our vacation went pretty much without meeting her and her devilspawn again.We are getting married in August.Thanks for reading ❤️
Okay Reddit 👏🏻 THIS 👏🏻 TEA 👏🏻 IS 👏🏻 SCOLDING 👏🏻 THIS MOTHER FUCKER HIT ME TODAY!!!!! So I’m pretty fucking heated rn so please excuse any spelling errors or word jumble because I swear to christ I almost choked an Abby Lee Miller looking ass soccer mom today and was willing to take the prison sentence for self gratification that some form of Justice would be served. Since my High School days I have moved to the east coast (would not recommend btw) and the drivers here range from acceptable to “I-Just-Got-My-License-For-My-16th-Birthday” drivers. With 95 and everything else it FKIN SUCKS. SO ANYWAYS! I was dropping a friends sibling off at soccer practice bc coincidentally she needed to get her front bumper fixed from a fender bender she was in. Now I have a perfect driving record, no accidents, to speeding tickets, only one non-moving traffic violation bc I barrow my dads car and a tail light was out. And I pay for my own car and car insurance (RIP to my bank account, CATCH MY ASS WITH THAT TOTALLY COLLUSION COVERAGE/REPLACEMENT AND LIABILITY INSURANCE ENTITLED MOM) So anyways, I drop my friends sister off and pull up to a four way stop since her soccer fields are right next to an apartment complex. I stop at the stop sign and then another car pulls up, a nice ass black BMW. I remember my mom always joked “Don’t fuck with nice cars, the owners probably have lawyers on retainer for car accidents” its a joke- but still. I see her come to a complete stop since we pulled up around the the same time and I start to go through the stop sign when I just feel a “WHAM!!” And my car gets pushed back. Out of panic I pull my emergency break to stop my car and I get out and see my drivers side back door, back bumper and tail light are FUUUUUUUUCKED. I run over to the mom FUCKING PISSED and before I could even get a word in she starts screaming at me like a banshee. She starts saying shit like “DO YOU KNOW HOW UNSAFE THAT WAS?!” “WHY DIDN’T YOU STOP AT THE STOP SIGN?!” “WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM!!!” And is screaming in my face. I look over in her car and her maybe 12-14 year old looking son is just staring at us with wide eyes like he’s in shock or some shit. I start screaming back that “I had come to a complete stop first!” and that “it felt like she floored the breaks when I was half way through the intersection!” And she got red in the face and started saying I’m accusing her of sabotage and that she’ll sue me for every penny I have. She was screaming so aggressively at me that I decided to call the cops. I wasn’t going to give this bat case my insurance information. She gets on her phone and calls her husband screaming to him but I just ignore her. I go back into my car lock all my doors and blast FGL until the sheriff (who was VERY CUTE I would like to add) arrives. When he gets there this ho-ho with acrylic nails starts yelling in his face about how I ran the stop sign and I’m probably an uninsured driver- ext ext.  I just stood there defeated looking because I knew the cop was going to take her side since I’m still technically an inexperienced driver. Still I patiently waited my turn and when he addressed me I explained my side of the story practically in tears and he looked over back at the mother and then looked at our cars. He evaluated the accident. There was no one else at the intersection except us unless a resident in the apartments right next to the fields saw something. He looks over everything and then suggested we should switch insurances and discuss with our agent. The woman scoffs and pulls out a State Insurance Card which is essentially minimum coverage insurance and then I come in HOT with my insurance card with my AAA Road Side Assistance Number. She suddenly got really pale realizing I AM INSURED AN MY RINKY LITTLE COROLLA is protected, as am I. I start writing down her info and she takes a pic of my card while the cop wrote some stuff down when BY THE GRACE OF OF GOD OR ALLAH OR WHATEVER FORCE RULES THIS UNIVERSE an apartment security guard pulls up. He gets out and asks whats going on and the cop explained it to him and he said very matter of fact, “Oh well we have security cameras at this intersection just for this reason, I can take you back to the guard gate and we can look them over.” Suddenly this beached whale looked TERRIFIED and said she had to take her son to soccer and he was on the elite team and was already late to which the cop said smugly, “no worried ma’am if you car drives go drop him off, we’ll wait and then go review the tapes.” She gave us all a dirty look I took a pic of the collision real quickly and then she headed over to the fields, the cop driving behind her (maybe to make sure she didn’t drive off idk?). We all pull up to the guard gate and he asked the time of the collision. I told him and in about 15 seconds he pulled up the video. The video CLEARLY showed me coming to a complete stop first and then she did and then me going through the intersection, AND LIKE I THOUGHT he flooring her gas pedal and rear ending me. She immediately started making some BS excuse about how her son has Autism and he was panicking because he was going to be late for practice to which the officer kindly said, “he seemed perfectly calm to me during the entire exchange.” The cop wrote some more stuff down- and then I called AAA and insurance to tow my car and to get me a rental until I could get repairs done. Since I am not at fault I’m not sweating this in the slightest. Moral of the story, don’t fucking break the law. Idk what she was thinking or thinking she could get out pf this, but she ended up getting the short end of the stick. Thanks for reading! A few updates: 1) I decided to wait on the date, even though a friend of mines dad told me its not really a big problem (and to correct he’s a deputy sheriff) I want to wait until my claim is settled to avoid conflict of interest. I’m young and didn’t understand that2) I won’t take her to court, I don’t have the time for that. I just want my car fixed. 3) I removed some statements in the pst bc they where mean spirited. I wrote this in anger originally and it was not nessesry. Updates 2:1) Insurance Finalized, I was not at fault and her insurance is covering the damages to my car, it kind of sucked because I’m not a confrontational person but with all the security videos and everything it clearly showed she ran the red. Took my car to a collision place, its all fixed up now. This was all finalized about 10 days ago. 2) Since all the insurance and repairs are finalized I took y’all advice and invested in a dash cam. No regrets. 3) the Deputy and I went on a date last night. It went very well and we like each other quite a bit. He invited me to the beach this weekend since its going to be warm out and I am very excited!Edit:Thank you all for the shiny stuff!! I really appreciate it! I didn’t think this post would get as many upvotes as it did. And thank you all for your suggestions, concerns and support!
(Cross-posting from r/childfree, cause they said this would totally fit here)Edit: BIL = brother in law.  FIL = father in lawA quick vent.Five  years ago, my husband and I bought a house. We'd been saving for years  for the down payment and the stars must have aligned for us to get it.  Everything worked out perfectly. The house was a major fixer-upper, but  it had land and we were happy with that!Turns  out BIL had looked at the house when it was listed as well. They  decided it was too much work to fix up and not worth it. They wanted  major upgrades too, whereas my husband and I are very simple people. We  don't need granite countertops or a soaking tub or hardwood throughout.Met  up with the family recently and the BIL was talking about how cramped  their condo has become with two kids now. BIL decided this was the time  to tell us that we should trade houses.I shit you not. (BIL is very, very entitled)BIL  proceeded to argue that we are only two people and their family is  growing and could use the space. Literally suggested that we give ours  to him and buy out his condo.I  laughed. I knew he was serious but I couldn't help but laugh. I'd never,  in my life, imagined someone could be so damn ENTITLED that they demand  someone give up their HOME for the sake of another family.*Are you kidding me?!*BIL then got MAD at me for not even considering it, and began justifying all the reasons his family needed our house more.Oh, you think this would be the worst part, right? No! It gets *better.*We  never finished the basement, so there is only one bathroom in the  house. BIL informed me that if we were to trade houses that we would  need to make some major upgrades first, because he wouldn't have time to  be able to make any renovations. He was somehow, inexplicably certain,  that I would see the logic in this plan and just... *trade houses* with them. Because they needed the extra space so much more.And now my BIL isn't talking to me, because I laughed through the whole thing and wouldn't take him seriously.Win-win.  Go ahead, punish me by not talking to me. At least then you'll stop  trying to make me the bad guy because I have two spare rooms I 'don't  use' (my husband and I each have an office) and tell everyone how  horrible I am because I wouldn't buy out your condo at market value  while giving you ours out of the goodness of our hearts.Last I know, he was now trying to tell my FIL to retire and move into the city so that they could have the farm.Jokes  on him... FIL already talked about it and has left the farm to me and  my husband in his will. Because we actually farm, and BIL thinks its too  much work.I always thought the internet exaggerated that people like this exist. I thought situations like this couldn't possibly be real.What the hell are these people thinking?!
So, I am F (17) and also on mobile, this is my EP story.My aunty and her 3 children came from Texas to visit us for the weekend. I wasn't happy, because her oldest son (19) would always pick on me when I was younger. It was the first time in 10 years that she visited.She comes into our house, with oldest son, and a younger son (12) and younger daughter (8). I put on my best fake smile and say hi. I tell the 2 youngest that they can go upstairs and play on my Xbox until it is supper. I sit down beside my twin brother and my mom. I do lots of video editing/Photoshop, etc. And Final Cut Pro X is my software of choice. I got 15 inch MacBook Pro a few months ago because of this, as my 2013 iMac wasn't cutting it.As everyone was talking, and me and brother are using our phones because our mom said we had to be down here to catch up with everyone, EA goes upstairs to see the house. I follow her and offer to show here around the house. When she goes up there, she sees my MacBook, and asks whos is that? This is how the convo goes down.EA = Entitled Aunt Me = Me (or Crusty)EA: Crusty! Who's laptop is that?Me: Oh! That's my laptop.EA: Can I hold it?Me: Um, sure....*EA holds it*N EA: Wow, Crusty, this feels nice. Can I keep it?Me: Um, absolutely not.EA: I'll pay you. This was probably like 500 dollars.Me: This is a 5000 dollar laptop! I worked my ass off for this thing. I am not just going to give it to you.EA: Crusty, I deserve it. I haven't seen you guys in 10 years, and you don't even get me a gift?Me: Is that my fault? I don't think so.EA: Well, since you won't give it to me, you shouldn't be able to use it, either.This bitch opened the laptop, and threw it on the ground, then stepped on it with her high heels. If we had carpeted floors, the laptop would've probably been fine, but we don't, and once she stepped on it, I knew it was done. I call my mom and dad, and they come running up. My mom asks why she did it and she literally mumbled "because she wouldn't give it to me" She, and all her children are banned from our house. I am turning 18 in less than a week, so I will wait until I am officially an adult to be able to sue her for damages. Wish me luck!Edit: holy cow thanks for the sliver! First post to get gilded! :DEdit 2: I am going to file a police report, and (hopefully) sue her. Congrats Reddit, You did it.Edit 3: I have filed a police report, and we're going to court. LET'S DO THIS.Edit 4: I'm 18! I can sue this bitch for my money. The trial is tomorrow! Edit 5: I won the case! I showed pics and everything to the judge, and my mom and dad heard the screaming, and when they came up, they saw her stepping on the laptop, and took pics. She owes me ALOT of money. I am so happy.
This happened back when I was in Kindergarten so some details are a bit fuzzy but the story is very much real.&#x200B;When I was in kindergarten, Entitled Boy came to class one day with Chicken Pox. This wasn't a mild case either, the spots were angry and red and within a few hours a couple of our classmates where itching. My teacher had immediately called his parents but they refused to pick him up, saying that it would be good for the other children to be around him and asking her to just leave him in the classroom.Now, only about half my class had gotten their chicken pox shots at that point. My parents were really good about getting my brothers and I our shots when we were supposed to get them, but as this was early in the school year, a lot of the parents hadn't gotten their kids vaccinated for chicken pox yet (to enroll in kindergarten at my elementary school you have to either vaccinate your kids before the school year starts, or within 3 months after). My teacher didn't know what to do, the office told her that if the parents wanted the kid to remain in class, she was technically supposed to let him unless other parents complained or the principal deemed him a danger to the other students. The principal was over at the high school on the other side of the city (he was principal of both, weird Christian school thing). He would rush over when he could but because of the school handbook the EB had to remain in class. My teacher asked the school secretary to call our parents, but she she only had home number for most parents, and ended up with a lot of answering machines.So in kindergarten everyone sat at table groups, and I was at EB's table. He was carrying on like normal, yelling about power rangers. I was also the only kid at our little table who had been vaccinated, I remember feeling bad because one of the girls was scheduled to get her shot THE NEXT DAY. Talk about bad luck.A lot of the kids at my table started itching, and the girl who was supposed to get her shot the next day showed me her arm, and she had very faint pink dots. I don't know if chicken pox usually moves that quickly, or if EB just had a super mutant strand, but I was freaked out. I knew I had gotten a shot that my mom promised would protect me from getting sick, but I was also 5 and still thought Stitch from Lilo and Stitch was a real being who lived in Hawaii. I was convinced that touching EB would mean I would die from Chicken Pox. So my friends and I all avoided him like he had, well, the plague.Finally the principal bursts into the room and kneels down in front of EB. He asks EB to please come with him so they can call his parents together.About 20 minutes later the Entitled Parents show up. Shit. Hits. The. Fan.Entitled Mom starts screaming about how both she and her husband are licensed chiropractors and know all about the evils of vaccines and how vaccines give people autism. (My oldest brother has Aspergers, if this had happened like five years later I could have roasted the hell out of these anti-vaxxers for their stupidity). Entitled Dad tries to calm EM down, but also quietly tells my principal that as licensed Chiropractors, they know and have seen how vaccines not only give children autism, but also make them GAY. (As a lesbian, I again could have again roasted the shit out of them had this taken place years later).My principal firmly tells them that EB needs to go home and can only come back when he is no longer sick. EP try to fight back but my principal is firm, and EB is dragged away from my class begging his parents for a new power rangers toy. As the week went on, more and more of my classmates dropped like flies, until only about 7 of us remained. We were the lucky seven who had been vaccinated prior to the start of the school year, and since most of the class was home sick, we got to play a ton of games and pick out the books we wanted to read (usually the class voted, and we 7 were often among the outvoted group). After a few days, my classmates began to return, not a red spot in sight. But it was a few weeks later that the real kicker happened. The Entitled Parents sent out emails to all the parents of kids in my class, painting themselves as the victims and heroes for "exposing the class to life's natural vaccine". My dad got mad, because even though I didn't get sick, (thanks parents who were on top of my vaccinations, y'all rock!), a lot of my classmates did. The Entitled Parents asked for a THANK YOU from the other parents, and needless to say, they got no thank yous and only a lot of passive aggressive remarks and glares in the hallway. Also, don't feel TOO bad for EB, he turned out to be one of the biggest entitled douche bags I've ever met, I went to school with him all the way up through high school and he's one of the worst humans I've had the displeasure of dealing with. The entitled apple doesn't fall far from the entitled tree.TL;DR: Entitled parents send their son to school with extremely contagious chicken pox, and then expect a thank you when over half the class gets infected.&#x200B;Edit: Look, this is a story that was told over and over again over the years by my family, so maybe a detail or something seems off, I just wrote the story as I remember it and as my family has told it over the years. Yes, chicken pox isn't necessarily a big deal on its own, but it can lead to shingles, which is horrible, later in life.  I don't know shit about incubation periods for chicken pox only that this is what happened and how people reacted to the situation, yeah the kids probably were already contaminated but this is how the situation played out in my class, so that's what I wrote. Also, I know quite a few people have expressed interest in more stories about EB  as I mentioned that I've dealt with that piece of shit for years, so I plan on posting some of the stories I have about him either here (some do involve his parents), or at r/entitledpeople or r/entitledkids. Thanks to everyone who's enjoyed the story and also, a hello to RSlash, Bumfris, Misery Box, and anyone else who shared my story on Youtube, I've enjoyed listening to you read this and also all the messages from people who told me to go watch your videos.
[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/bbaeyr/ep_inconvenienced_by_my_cancer_diagnosis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) Family Meeting Update: I went in an hour early for a family meeting with EP and her husband to discuss what happened yesterday. EP: Were you able to reschedule so you can come to our family reunion?Me: No, like I told you yesterday I can't reschedule. Husband: What are you having to reschedule? Maybe we could give you some paid time off before the reunion so you can take care of whatever it is and still come with us. Having you there would really help us out. EP: We already made plans in the evening with friends so we need you to watch Baby. Me: Unfortunately I can't reschedule. Like I told you yesterday, I am having to have one of my ovaries removed because I have cancer. Husband: Oh my God, I'm so sorry to hear that CurlyGirly. EP: You're what, 25? People don't get ovarian cancer that young. What's the real reason you can't go? Husband: Jesus Christ EP, people can get cancer at any age.  Me: I’m not lying. Husband: Why would she lie? EP: No. Husband: What do you think the Make A Wish foundation is for? Children with cancer! You can get it at any age EP... EP: *flustered* well how was I supposed to know that?! I just thought she didn't want to go and was trying to get out of it! Husband: Christ EP... EP: What?! Husband: CurlyGirly I am so so sorry. Thank you for all you do with Baby, we know how much he loves you. Me: I care a lot about Baby and I've really enjoyed working for y'all, but the incident yesterday was unprofessional and upsetting. Next Friday will be my last day working for y'all. If you find someone to replace me before then I'd be happy to train them.EP: WHAT Husband: I see...EP: YOU'RE JUST GOING TO QUIT? Husband: EP, stop.EP: It wasn't that big of a deal and you're quitting? I thought you loved Baby?! Husband: EP THAT'S ENOUGH.*EP starts to choke up and looks like she going to cry* Husband: CurlyGirly I am sorry to hear that we will be losing you. I am deeply sorry for what occured yesterday and any stress that may have caused you. EP: *quietly* It's not my fault. Husband: No one said it was your fault.EP: YOU JUST DID! *EP stomps off crying. Husband follows and returns alone after 5 minutes*Husband: CurlyGirly why don't you take the rest of the week off. I'll still pay you for those hours, but I think it'd be best to have EP's mom watch baby while we figure things out. Me: Yeah, okay. I'll see you on Monday then? Husband: See you Monday. And again, I'm so sorry for everything. Me: I appreciate that. Then I left and got some pancakes and typed this up. Edit: I would like to throw out there that is is very possible something is going on in EP's life or mental state that's leading her to act this way. Aside from this experience I generally enjoyed working for their family and felt respected and valued by both her and her husband. Was this experience upsetting? Yes. Do I want to continue to work for them when I have to interact with her everyday because she works from home? No. However, from what I've seen she's a good wife and mother. I hope whatever caused her behavior is dealt with and I wish her all the best.Also thank you to everyone for the well wishes! I will definitely update after the surgery. It really warms my heart how kind and supportive everyone has been.
So I collect fountain pens (r/fountainpens if you’re interested, or my post history for the pens in question!), some of which are very beautiful, rare, and expensive. A significant amount of my collection is cheap Chinese knockoff pens that I have for inking dozens or even hundreds of inks at once, but I mostly keep them to give away to people who are interested in dipping their toes in the hobby. They’re certainly not BAD pens, but nothing like my nicer ones and not as... extravagant looking.I used to work at an extended day camp over summers and am still friends with the people I worked with there. Next to the classroom building is a park with a playground, which is technically a public park but I’ve never seen anyone but people related to the school use it. At the end of the day when parents are picking up their kids, we’d bring the kids to the playground to wait for their parents. Last week I went to pick up my friend who worked there, and hung around with her at the playground because there was one last little girl (5ish years old I think) there whose mom was a bit late. She seemed really sweet and interested in my stuff, so I showed her my pen collection and she asked politely to try one. I was happy to show her how to use one of my cheapie pens, and she was very gentle and patient with it so I told her if her mom gave permission she could pick out a cheapie to keep! Eventually her mom showed up with another mom and another fiveish year old girl. She immediately ran to her mom and started excitedly telling her about the pens, and her mom said she could have one so she ran back and carefully picked one out. While she was happily showing her mom, I heard the other mom telling her kid “Go ahead and pick one”. The other little girl came up and immediately pointed at one of my (admittedly very colorful and sparkly) expensive pens and said “I’d like this one please”. She was never pushy during the whole incident, so I can’t fault the child, the mom though...So I started explaining to her that that was my personal collection, and if I could show her how to use one of the cheapies and if she was nice to it I would let her pick one of those. She seemed to understand and just said ok, but her MOM interrupted and said “Excuse me, you let (the other little girl) pick whatever she wanted, you have to let mine choose.” So I start to explain again that this is like a $600 pen and she’s angrily like “No, that’s the one she picked so you HAVE to give it to her.”I’d like to say I had some kinda of repartee with her where I showed her how dumb she is, like some of you post, but I was just dumbfounded and could only stare at her in shock for a second. My brain was like PENS IN DANGER, so I just zipped up my case, packed it in my bag, and started walking away to get my friend and go. This lady is getting upset and trying to stop me the whole time I’m walking away, but I didn’t say another word to her as we left. I feel bad about her kid who really wasn’t that bad, but no one NEEDS a fountain pen. Except me, obviously.EDIT (NOT NECESSARY FOR THE STORY): Ok too many repeating comments to respond to:1. Yes, the word pen can look like the word penis. 2. The pen she picked was [this Pen18111 Ginkgo Leaf!](https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/avszq7/pen_18111_and_iroshizuku_fuyu_syogun/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app) Yoshi Nakama hand makes and turns the resin, laser engraves and then hand paints the images with pearlescent powder and 3D prints the roll stop in wax and then casts in 18k gold plated brass! Plus a gold nib of course.3. People interested in starting into the hobby, that’s awesome! r/fountainpens has info and recommendations for people starting out in the side bar, but I’m happy to answer questions. Goulet Pens has great resources and videos explaining the basics. For recommendations, basically Pilot Metropolitan, TWSBI Eco, and Lamy Safari are great under $30 pens that can last a lifetime. Chinese knockoffs and Platinum Preppies can be bought for a few dollars. So happy for you, but don’t blame me if you get sucked in ;)4. Weird people down in the downvotes, no it’s not my fault for having nice things in public, get some help. 5. Anyone could live their life with the cheapest most basic stuff, but I use my pens all day every day and they spark joy. Same as fancy cars/computers/cameras/anything. Reasons to use fountain pens: customize design/material/nib/ink/etc. Inks can be any color/waterproof/fraud proof/glow under black light/sparkly/shimmery/shading/etc.! Fountain pens are more ergonomic because you don’t press on the paper and can get a weight and balance right for your hand- I write up to 40 hours straight so this is important to me. Fountain pen nibs feel different than other pens. Gold nibs eventually conform to the way you write, or you can get any nib customized for your way of writing. There are many kinds of nibs that produce different marks such as italic, flex, architect, oblique, fude, arabic, folded, and more! They aren’t disposable (except varsities) so they’re better for the environment and if you have self control they can save you money (not me...). Awesome community of nice people online/at shows and meetups and brick and mortar store and workshops. Pens can also appreciate in value if they’re rare and well made. Buying handmade pens is like buying a work of art you can use every day. Also they’re pretty, and you’re less likely to lose something you love and spent more than a dollar on! Other reasons I can’t think of right now too! 6. Also I’m not a guy, but it would be pretty great if more guys carried around pretty sparkly colorful pens and weren’t afraid to hang out with kids at playgrounds! ...maybe. We live in a society.
Hi Everyone,Here is the link to my original post aka[Event One](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/c8pk1d/em_breaks_into_my_backyard_to_use_my_swimming_pool/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)Sorry for not updating in a while but I have been incredibly busy at work and was not able to find time to update. Here are few more things that EM has done to my family and my neighbors since the first incident. Event Two:I came home from shopping the next day and found out that EM went into my backyard a second time. I was out at the hardware store buying a new lock for the gate when this occurred. Before I had left to go shopping, I asked my elderly neighbor to keep an eye out for EM just in case.Here is what my neighbor told me happened. She said that EM and her kids were in my yard playing with my family’s lawn games. We have several such as lawn darts, ladder ball, a fake axe throwing game, etc. She didn’t know how long they had been in the yard but when she noticed them, she went onto her deck and told them to leave. After making a fuss again, they complied and left. Apparently a lot of swearing and a full blown tantrum was involved.I went into the yard to investigate and see if anything had been taken. Nothing was taken but a most of the games had damage. A few darts were snapped, an axe was broken and my inflatable unicorn float for the pool was popped.I was livid at this point and I couldn’t believe this happened again. I spoke to my parents about this incident and I wanted to call the police. My parents told me not to bother though that it was just cheap stuff and that I should let it go. They told me that the police wouldn’t care about something so trivial. Ultimately they are the homeowners so it was not my decision.I did make a point of taking all the broken pieces and throwing them over her front lawn. A few bags of dog waste included for extra fun. Event Three:The EKs went into another elderly neighbor’s front garden and picked almost everyone of her flowers. She had a beautiful garden with roses and other expensive flowers in it. I was my neighbors’ pride and joy. She had been working on that garden ever since I was a child.I was walking my dog when I found her crying in her garden as she cleaned up the mess. When she told me the story of what had happened it broke my heart. I asked her if she was going to call the police and she said that she already had. They had come earlier in the day and had gone over to talk to EM.EM defended her EKs actions by saying that it was her birthday and the EKs thought she deserved a beautiful present (wasn’t that lovely of them?). She even proudly showed the bouquet off to the police officers. The police didn’t do anything other than give her a verbal warning and file a report.Event Four:The neighborhood has a park only three houses down from EMs home. Instead of walking they’re like a normal person she would load her kids up in the car and drives them over. There isn’t a parking lot at this park and most people who drive their will park on the side of the road.Not EM, though she will run over the curb and park directly beside the children’s playground equipment. She has done this numerous times regardless of if there are other people at the playground. She will just honk her horn at you and scream for you to move. I have a video and pictures of her doing this. For the purpose of keeping this anonymous I am not going to post them as our park has a unique setup.Some of the other neighborhood parents were obviously furious over her actions and she was confronted about her behavior. I stood with them watching as I was walking my dog at the time and I was very curious to see how this ended.They told her she could hit a child or animal by doing this. She just started saying we were racist and that we were harassing her. She then went and called the police on us. She was acting very smug by doing this and seemed genuinely proud of herself. She told the group that we were going to be sorry for the way we have treated her since she moved in.  As soon as the police came, she began to cry and claim that we had all been harassing her for weeks. She made up a whole bunch of lies about things we had done to her. She even threw herself on the ground and acted like a child. Two of her kids joined in on this tantrum and the others just continued to play.The police interviewed everyone who was present and it very clear that she was wrong in this situation. The police pulled her aside and talked to her. She was given a very hefty ticket for reckless driving and she was told that if this happened again, she would be charged. For once she was silent and just left with her kids. To my knowledge she has not done this again since. That is all is all I have time to tell you about right now and I better get back to work before my boss notices. I wish I had more time to tell you everything that has happened, but I promise to update again soon.
Hey internet people!  Long time lurker on this sub (and Reddit in general), first time poster here.  English is my first language and I'm on PC, so I don't have any excuses.  This is more of an EntitledFamily story but has an EM in here so I thought I'd give it a shot.Little back story... I came from a highly dysfunctional family and tried to spend as much time away from them as possible.  In third grade (9-10 yo) I met a set of twins that would become life long friends and their family a second to my own.  At the head of their family was their grandfather.  He was an extremely rough-around-the-edges, no bull giving or taken, my-way-or-the-highway kinda guy and the fact he was half Mexican and half Mescalero Apache didn't help.  Everyone one of us boys at the house was scare to death of him and NO ONE wanted to go out of town with him to work.  When I was 21, I ended up helping him on a job outside of Fort Worth and during this time we bonded.  I called him Pop and he called me son.A couple of months after we started the Fort Worth job, Pop received a call that his aunt had passed away.  We stayed up having a few drinks and he told me stories about her till the roster crowed.  He described her to me in the same manner that us boys would describe him to others.  Now this woman would drink a fifth of bourbon and smoke five cigars everyday till the day she died but she made it to nearly 100 before she croaked.  During the last 20 or so years of her life, the majority of her family had absolutely nothing to do with her, with the exception of one grandson.  She had also amassed a nice little spread outside of Waco, having a 100+ acre ranch, a large farm house and a seven figure back account.Pop decided that we should attend the funeral.  A few days later, we found ourselves in a small funeral parlor in the crap-tastic town of Waco.  The funeral was going as all funerals go with some people sobbing, others binge drinking and most of the kids looking bored AF.  As Pop and I are sitting quietly, minding our own, we hear this increasingly louder conversation behind us... Enter the cast...EM - Grandson's Mom EF1, 2 and 3 - Entitled Family, most likely the other daughters GG - The Good GrandsonEF1 - "Really? Everything? What do you mean, everything?"EM  -"That's what the lawyer said!"EF2 - "She can't do this to us!  Can she?"EF3 - "There has got to be something that we can do about this.  It's his fault she died! If he hadn't of provided her with whiskey and cigars all those years she would still be alive!"EM - "Don't worry.  He's my son and will do whatever I say.  We'll sell everything and split it evenly between just the four of us."It was at this point Pops caught on to what was being discussed, as I'm sure everyone else around had, and he being a man not to hold his tongue, lost it.  It went something like this... "Y'all need to shut y'alls asses!" (he loved to say that) "This woman lived to be nearly 100 years old and your going to try and say he killed her!  Over what? Money?  If you cared so much about her, where were y'all the last 20 years of her life?  He didn't do it for the money, he did it because it was his grandma and it was the right thing to do!"Before EM and EFs could regain there composure, GG came up, looked his mom in the eye and said "Goodbye mom.  This is the last time any of y'all will see me again" and simply walked out the door.  The last I heard about any of it, GG was enjoying his life out on the ranch and refused to have any contact with his immediate family.  I spent about another 6 months traveling with pops, working construction and learning masonry.  He passed about 7-8 years back.  I miss that man.  Even if no one reads this, it felt really nice to talk about Pop.EDIT - Obligatory "Holy S\*\*\*! This blew up.  Thanks for the jewels, kind strangers!"  But really, thanks for all the kind words about Pops.  He really was a great man and I miss him very much.  And to all the Grammar Nazis out there, thanks for pointing out my typos; I'm going to leave them just to dick with y'all.
TL;DR at the bottomI was 12, my parents moved us to a new place, our neighbours were unpleasant. There were the EM and Father (never met him, can't call him entitled), with two sons, one was 13 and the other was about 8 or 9. The older brother (OB) was a decent guy, we were school bus pals, but the younger one was an issue, but looking back on it he probably had a social disorder like Aspergers or perhaps ADHD. My mum did not like this kid, a few incidents happened before with him and my mum nicknamed him the Orange-haired Goblin, I'll call him OG. This story is told from my mother's perspective, as she dealt with EM. Despite this happening over 10 years ago, I do remember that it happened, but the written dialogue here is pulled from my mother's retelling of the story, so there's a tad of embellishment.This was in the day of dial-up in my country, it was fantastic. My mum and I had a system where I'd quickly load a flash game with a heads up, then disconnect from the internet and plug the phone back in. It was the school holidays so it was just my mum and I at home when dad was at work, so it was an otherwise empty house when this happened...Mum: OP, you're supposed to give a heads up when you're unplugging the phone, I need to make a call.Me: (from the backyard) I'm not on the computer though, I'm outside.-> Mum pokes her head out the kitchen window, sees me, looks confused, then turns around. She and I have the same idea, so we both head to the room with the computer, and we find OG. Mum: Excuse me, what are you doing?OG: My mum told me I could use your computer.Mum: Why don't you use yours? (Despite hating this kid, my mother is not unreasonable, she's not going to get annoyed with a 8-9 year old)OG: I broke it.Mum: Well I'm sorry but she can't decide that, you have to ask for permission. Besides, you can't let yourself in our house anyway. You can finish the game but I need to plug the phone back in so you can't load anything else.-> Mum then gives me a look that meant "keep an eye on him", she later told me she didn't want him to break our computer if he indeed broke his own, so she needed me to keep an eye on him.OG then leaves, then 10min later we hear a knock on the door, I go to answer but my mum gets there first.EM: OG told me you won't let him on your computer.Mum: Sorry, who?EM: My son.Mum: Oh right, the kid who let himself in. He told me you told him he could use my computer, why is that?EM: His was broken and I needed to entertain him. Mum: So that makes it okay? I wouldn't have minded letting him if you had just discussed it with me first. EM: He's an angel, there's no harm in him using it.Mum: Clearly there is if he broke his one.-> at this point, EM must have been getting annoyed. I heard this part for myself as she started shouting very loudly.EM: HE ONLY BROKE HIS KEYBOARD, HE SPILLED HIS DRINK ON IT. ITS SAFE FOR HIM TO USE YOURS BECAUSE HE LEARNED HIS LESSON.Mum: Still doesn't give him or you the right to come and go as you please and use our property without permission!EM: BUT YOU SAID YOU WOULD HAVE LET HIM SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM.Mum: My problem is a strange kid I barely know just walked into my house and used my computer because "his mother said he could". If that's how you treat your neighbours then you or your children aren't welcome here anymore. -> My mum then slammed the door, and that was the last we heard from EM, though she'd stare at us if she saw us leave the house. My mum would make jokes about the kid if she saw him in the street, like "crap it's the Orange-haired Goblin, remember to lock the door". When school resumed, I was talking to the older brother on the school bus. He told me that his mother asked him to steal our keyboard if he ever comes around again. He understood his mother was a whackadoodle so we just had a laugh about it.TL;DR My mum finds the neighbour's kid let himself in to our house to use our computer with his mother's permission. My mum sends him home to the fury of EM. EM demands we let her angel use our computer, my mum refuses, so EM asks her older son to steal our keyboard.P.S. a lot of people are wondering how the kid got inside without us knowing. Doors are usually kept unlocked where we live, but we learned our lesson and started locking it after.P.P.S. the EM asked her older son to steal the keyboard because she knew I was friendly with him, she didn't ask OG to steal it. Sorry for any confusion.
This happened last week, so i'm trying to wrap my head around it still.&#x200B;Firstly, I love guns. nearly everything about them. the sound, the recoil, the fireball. what I don't like is when an idiot is given one. When idiots have guns, people get killed. So when I see an EP and her nine y/o son at a gun range, i was initially happy that this kid was being taught at a young age. I go to my bay (right next to EP and son, who was actually quite nice), when I see EP's handgun pointed at me. So I jump out of the way of the barrel, and tell her to keep it downrange. She scoffs at me, pulls the "not loaded" BS, to which I reply that I don't care, always treat it like it's loaded. I had two guns with me. My Springfield XD-40 subcompact handgun, and my AR-15. Now, continuing the story.&#x200B;You should all know who is who in terms of abbreviations.&#x200B;The kid goes up to shoot. He starts firing, and when he's done, he sets the gun down so that ti points at me. Being a kid, and probably new, I tell him to always keep it downrange, for safety. he acknowledges this, and points the gun back, when I feel a firm smack to the back of my head.&#x200B;EP- Don't talk to my son like that!Me- I'm trying to teach him gun safety. If anybody gets shot at one of these ranges, the place can get shut down.EP- Don't talk back to me!&#x200B;She moves to hit me again, to which I hover my hand over my XD-40 which was resting on the table. That sends her enough signal to back off. When she goes up to shoot, she pulls the trigger, to which... nothing happens.&#x200B;She points the gun at me AGAIN, to which this time I yell at her to keep it downrange. She decides to ignore me.&#x200B;Me- Ma'am, if the gun misfires, keep it down range because it may have had a delayed firing!EP- Shut up, asshole!&#x200B;I go back to shooting my handgun, to which I see, once again, that the gun is pointed at me. The worst part?&#x200B;SHE WAS FIDDLING WITH THE GODDAMNED TRIGGER!&#x200B;To those who don't know, the rule is that you can point your gun at somebody if you feel they genuinely jeopardize your life. I wasn't quite there yet, so I called over range safety. Range safety told her off,  and she listened, UNTIL SHE DID THE SAME DAMNED THING. Now I point my gun at her.&#x200B;EP- WhAt ThE FUcK u DOInG?me- KEEP YOUR GUN DOWNRANGE!range safety comes over to calm me down, and he takes the gun from EP. Then EP tries to throttle range safety. So I take the gun from him, and field strip it (disassembly in case of emergency). I noticed the safety was on, but the gun was fully loaded. So I point my gun at EP and tell her to get on her knees with her hands behind her head.EP- I'll sue you for this bullshit!me- (to the little kid) never say anything you have heard today until you are older. (back to EP) Go ahead. I'll just show that camera footage.&#x200B;Range safety calls the cops, and when they arrive, I field strip both my guns. I get cuffed, asked a few questions, and then released to put my guns in their cases. EP is screaming bloody murder as she's taken away, and the kid is just crying. So then I go the the kid, and try to calm him down. EP then screams that i'm trying to kidnap her son. I just back away (and the kid has calmed down) and just put my hands up. Cops close the car door, and then they get contacts for the kid's dad.&#x200B;Still waiting for a court date. I will update you when I do get one.Okay y'all, my post was locked by somebody. No issue, but this is called "my right to free speech being ass-fucked."Silvers and gold? And 11k upvotes? Thank you all!
Cast: EM-entitled mom, EG-entitled grandma, SB-spoiled brat, Me-well me This happened about a year ago, but I just booked tickets for another long flight and it made me think of this. I was flying from Hawaii to NY and had a layover in Chicago. The flight from Hawaii to Chicago was about 10 hours long, and I had booked my flight well in advance so I could have my choice of seats. I chose the window seat on the exit row and as I was waiting in the airport I was excited knowing my seat was going to be perfect. We start boarding and I’m one of the first groups to board so I make sure I have everything I need from my bag, put my headphones on, and start my Netflix binge. About 10 minutes in the women next to me taps me on the shoulder EG- Hi sweetie, I’m flying with my family and my granddaughter would like to be in the window seat I should explain the layout of the plane. There’s three seats on the left and right side and four seats in the middle. EG  and her husband were sitting in the seats next to me on my side and the rest of her family (EM and her 3 kids all between 2-8 years old) were sitting in the middle row. Me: I’m sorry, I chose this seat because I know how long of a flight it’s going to be. I would offer to let her sit here during takeoff and then switch, but she looks really young and I don’t think they allow children to sit in the exit row.EM overhearing our conversation: So you’re just going to be heartless and deny my daughter her window seat? SB:Mom you told me I could have it!! Tell her it’s mine!! She starts having a temper tantrum and screaming while sitting in the aisle, holding up the entire line of people tying to get to their seats EG: Look what you did! You broke that little girls heart! I hope you know there’s a place in hell for people like you The flight attendant had heard the girls tantrum at this point and started coming overFA: what seems to be the issue?Me: These people asked me to switch..EM- This girl stole my daughters seat!! She shoved her way in as I was helping my daughter with her bag and now she refuses to give us the seat back! Me: I have my ticket that shows that this is my seat EG- She stole the ticket from my grand baby! I saw her do it! Me, extremely frustrated at this point: It has my name on it, and I have my license to prove it’s my name FA looks over everything FA: This is her seat. Also, your daughter is way to young to be in an exit row. Please don’t disturb this young lady again The rest of the flight I endured dirty looks from the family, and at one point EG tried to spill a drink on me as the flight attendant was handing it to me. Hopefully this next flight I can just sit in silence.
So there's a garage on the left hand side if my house where I park my car, and a driveway in front of it so the car can get inside. It's exactly like any other garage, and it is part of my property, yet some people feel that they're entitled enough to park just anywhere, including right in front of my fucking driveway.EM = Entitled Mom Me = Me EC = Entitled childIt starts off when I'm about to go to the convenience store to get snacks, and I notice there's a car literally parked right smack in the middle of my driveway. There's no way my car could possibly get around, and I wasn't having any of it. So I yelled "WHO THE FUCK OWNS THIS CAR" and started blasting my horn. It took awhile for someone to finally react, and it just so happened to be the entitled bitch who owned the car. Apparently she was a mom of two kids, and she kept reminding me of that while I was arguing with her.EM: WHAT ARE YOU DOING MAKING NOISE, MY KIDS ARE TRYING TO SLEEP!Me: I apologize Miss, but some asshole decided it was a good idea to park right in front of my driveway.EM: Yeah, that's my car, the spot I normally park in was taken by one of the neighbors and that was the only place I could park.Now at first I actually felt sympathy for this woman. She had kids and everything and she wasn't wrong about the car taking up her spot because one of my other neighbors had a party celebrating their nieces Quincienera and the neighborhood was packed with cars, AND she didn't have a driveway of her own, so she had to park somewhere on the street. So I decided to calm down and nicely ask her to move her car, but instead of accepting my generosity, she decides to keep arguing with me.EM: I am not moving my car, its late and I have to make sure my children get to bed.Keep in mind it was only about 8:30 at the time, it wasn't late at all for her to move her car.Me: I can't get my car out of here when your parked in the driveway, I'm asking you again to please move your car.EM: What could you possibly be doing this late at night that requires you to drive somewhere???Me: I'm just headed to the convenience store to get-EM: I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'RE GETTING, YOU CAN WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW TO GET YOUR SHIT!She was really getting on my nerves. I got ready to raise my voice but then I had an idea. So I reply with "Okay." and walk back inside my house. When I looked back I saw she had that "Yeah, I totally showed him" look on her face. I tried not to get pissed off at that as I reached for the phone and called the police. I explain the situation and a few minutes later a tow truck arrives.The car was in fact illegally parked, and so it was impounded. The next day, early in the morning I get a knock on my door. Obviously it's the bitch mother. Her kids were standing next to her. She immediately starts yelling at me as soon as I open the door. Apparently she was going to take her kids to an amusement park, and now that they didn't have a car, there's practically no way for them to go. As soon as she tells me that I immediately chuckle, which pisses her off even more, meanwhile her kids are crying.EC: Mommy! I really want to go!Me being the insensitive asshole I point at the kid and let out a big "HAH!", which causes him to start screaming like a Banshee. The mom starts yelling at me saying how much of a monster I am, I just reply with "Get a cab slut" and slam the door in her face. I may or may not have been a little to harsh, but that family of idiots got what they deserved.
Another post about a parent volunteering their adult child reminded me of this. It happened to my cousin but I was there for the majority of the story. I remember it so clearly for a couple of reasons, in addition to just having a good memory. It was the first trip after my father had died and it was, sadly, the last trip I took with my mother. She died less than a year later. TL/DR at the bottom.My aunt was always playing the big shot of solving people's problems but using my cousin as the actual person to take on the problem.....always for free. If someone insisted on paying, EA kept the money. Need a babysitter? A ride? House cleaned? Yard mowed? Errands run? "Oh, my daughter can do it!" As far as my aunt was concerned, the only reason Emily existed was to cater to her. Emily, was her ultimate trophy. EA was entitled long before it became a huge thing.    Cast:  EA-Entitled Aunt  Emily-Cousin  Mike-Emily's boyfriend  Me-ACCER  PO 1-Police Officer 1  PO 2 -Police Officer 2  Judge-Judge  My aunt has always been entitled. It's her personality type. My mother couldn't stand her little sister so we tried to avoid her, while still maintaining contact with her husband and child. My uncle (their brother) lived further south in the state so we always tried to avoid EA knowing when we were visiting. On this trip, I was staying with my cousin for a couple of weeks in the summer and we were going to do the tourist things. EA thought that the university not being in session meant that cousin was slave labor.  One day Emily decided that enough was enough. She was supposed to run errands for a friend of EA and had told her mother she had plans. Her mother, as usual, acted as though Emily had agreed and expected her to comply. Emily just didn't run the errand for the friend as demanded. It was that simple. My mother and I had arrived about 10 minutes before the phone rang. EA called and though this was back during landlines, she was screaming so loudly that both my mother and I could hear both sides clearly. EA: How DARE you embarrass me with my friends! You call Mrs. Noname and apologize immediately! You are grounded for a month and you may not drive the car, at all. Now you make that call and go run those errands NOW. (If anyone can explain how she was supposed to do this without using the car, I'd like to know)Emily: Mom, I'm 22. I do not live in your house, you do not pay my bills, and you do not own my car. Run the errands yourself. I have plans. My mom was a little nervous leaving us at that point (it's a mom thing....and a she has met her sister thing) even though we were both fine. She left just after meeting Emily's boyfriend. We left and went to a water park and a few other things. We got back to the house and were talking about where to have dinner (mom insisted on paying for us to go someplace really nice for dinner that night.)We get back and Emily's car is gone. She called and asked where it was:Emily: Mom? Do you have my car?   EA: Yes, I do. Your father brought me over so I could check and see if you had obeyed me. I told you that you were grounded and you were not there when I arrived. I'm keeping the car for a month but I'm going to let Mrs. Noname borrow it because you have been so horrible to her.   Emily: Mom, that's stealing. I want my car back now or I'm going to report it stolen. No, Mrs. Noname can't drive my car.  EA: I'm your MOTHER! What I say goes, missy. You need to learn some respect and to get it through your head that I'm in charge and you are the child. You don't own anything....it's MINE because I am your MOTHER! The police will likely arrest you for wasting their time. Emily hangs up and looks at me. She is so angry she is crying in rage. Emily: ACCER, if I call the police she's going to know you are here.   Me: I can live with that. (THAT fallout is a whole other story)  She picks up the phone and calls the police. Tells them the car has been taken without her permission and where it is. Mike drives us over there. We do not want to miss the show. PO1 knocks on the door, EA answers.EA: Hello, officers. Do you need something?PO1: Ma'am, the vehicle in the drive matches the description and location of a vehicle reported stolen.EA: It's my car. I took it from my daughter because she is grounded from using it for being disobedient and disrespectful. PO2: I see, may we have a word with her, please? EA (looking very smug): She doesn't live here. PO1 (Who had noticed us across the street): You three! Come over here please!PO1: Did one of you call us?Emily: I did. It's my car officer. My mother seems to think that she has control over it and me. EA: It's MY car! I'm your mother and you have to obey me, it's the law! Tell her officers!PO2: Actually, Ma'am, there is no such law. Your daughter is an adult. EA: There most certainly IS such a law! I'm going to report you to your chief for not knowing it, I may even sue!PO1 (to cousin): May I see the car registration, and your license please?Emily hands them to him.PO1: Ma'am, this car is registered in the name of your daughter and only your daughter. It's her car and you have no right to drive it. EA looks at the registration the officer is showing her and then snatches Emily's license from him and slams the door. The police officers look at each other for a moment and then shrug and ring the bell again. EA answers it, looking very smug. PO1: Ma'am, I'm going to need you to return the license, now. EA hands him the license........that she has cut into several pieces. EA: Now she CAN'T drive because she doesn't have a license! She looks at Emily as though she just scored some odd victory......then she finally notices me. EA: ACCER! What are you doing here! Me: Just trying to have a nice visit with my cousin (she has hated me for years.)EA: You need to leave. I didn't give you permission to visit. Where is your mother?Me: I don't need your permission. My mother is not here. I can travel without her. PO1: Ma'am, you are under arrest for destruction of government property (apparently cutting up a valid license is a felony in some places....who knew?) and grand theft of this car. EA: You can't arrest me, I'm her mother, I have rights!PO2: Yes, you do. (He then reads them to her)  The officer explains to us that until she destroyed the license he had been willing to issue an appearance ticket. Then instead of being arrested she would just have had to appear in front of the judge.....and get a fine. This was a much bigger deal. Emily ran into the house to tell her father what had happened. We all chatted for a little bit until the phone rang. It was EA telling him to call their attorney. We left. I drove the car back to Emily's and took her to get her license replaced the next morning.   The attorney called by my uncle apparently didn't know my aunt and he showed up at the first hearing, a week later, to try and get it dismissed. It looked to be going her way at first. &#x200B;EA Attorney: You Honor, this is a family matter. It's simply a case of a mother disciplining her child and the child calling the police because her mother grounded her from using the car. Judge: So she got mad and called the police and she, not knowing that it was a crime to destroy the license, did so?EA Attorney: Yes, your Honor, that's pretty much it. Judge: Prosecutor, do you have nothing better to do today?Prosecutor: No, your Honor, I don't. I consider it rather important. When a 22 year old woman has her car stolen, it doesn't matter who stole it. She has just as much of a right to justice as someone who has their car stolen by a stranger. Judge: 22? The victim is 22?Prosecutor: Yes, your Honor. The victim is a 22 year old woman who is the sole owner of the vehicle in question. Her mother became enraged at her daughter. She then went to her daughter's home, stole her car and later destroyed her license. EA Attorney: Your Honor? I was not aware of the age or living situation of the victim. I was under the impression that the "child" was a minor who resides with her parents.   EA was sitting there still looking smug. Her attorney was sweating bullets. Judge: EA, do you realize that these are very serious charges and if convicted you face up to 8 years in prison? EA: For what? I have the right to discipline my child as I see fit. She disobeyed me. She will think twice before doing it again.Judge: No, you don't. You have the right to discipline your child within the confines of the law. You have stepped outside of that parameter. You stole your daughter's car.EA: I'm her mother, it's my right. It isn't really theft because she is my child and her property belongs to me, by law!Judge: Where did you get your law degree?EA: I don't have one. Judge: Then let me be the first to explain to you that your child is a legal adult. PERIOD. You have no right to anything of hers without her express consent. PERIOD. You may not take her car without her permission. PERIOD. You may not enter her home without her permission. PERIOD. Do you understand that?EA: You don't know what you are talking about! I'm her mother. That gives me the right. I'm in charge!Judge: No, Ma'am, I'M in charge. This case will be held over for trial. &#x200B;I went home a week later. EA eventually took a plea deal where she had 2 years probation and had to take parenting classes. The parenting classes were Mike's idea and the prosecutor thought it was great. We laughed hysterically over that because my cousin is an only child.....lol. Emily and Mike married a year later......and moved the hell away from there. This took place about 30 years ago. EA maintained for the rest of her life that the judges (there were 5 for different status hearings) didn't know what the hell they were doing and she was right. TL/DREntitled Aunt thinks she can punish adult child by taking her car, the police and the judge disagree with her.
This happened yesterday, and yes, it was as stupid as it sounds.So, for some quick context, I'm a cleaner at a private school. It costs something like £25k a year to send your kid here, so you can imagine the amount of rich, entitled BS that goes on. You already know who EM and me are, so let's get into it.It's 4pm, and I've been at work for an hour just getting on with what I'm doing, and the EM comes storming into the classroom I'm cleaning.EM: You need to move your car.Me: What? Why?EM, speaking very slowly and loudly for some reason: Y O U  N E E D  T O  M O V E  Y O U R  C A R.Me, copying her tone: N O  I  D O N ' T.EM: (does some confused blinking) Why are you talking like that?Me: Because you were.EM: Ugh, whatever, just move your stupid car. Its blocking me, and I have an appointment.Me: Lady, my car isn't blocking you. I'm parked along the back row, by a hedge, blocking nobody.EM: You're lying! Come and move your car right now!This goes on for about 5 minutes, and eventually I figure she won't shut up unless I do something.Me: Look, if I prove that my car isn't the one blocking you, will you get out of my face?EM: Finally, just move the stupid thing so I can go.So I go get my keys from the cupboard where my stuff is, EM practically glued to my shoulder the whole time, go to the car park, press the button on my key, and the lights blink on my beat up Fiat in the corner.Me: See, my car. Right there. Not blocking anyone.Thinking that's the end of it, I turned to go back to my job, and she started screaming behind me.EM: You stole those keys! That's not your car, your car is in front of mine! Get your keys right now and move it!Me: Okay, which car do you think is mine? (I figured if it's a staff member's car, I could direct the crazy bitch to them)She marched over to a Range Rover (presumably hers) which was blocked in by a brand new Porsche - A BRAND NEW FREAKING PORSCHE - and glared at me.I must have stared at her for at least 10 seconds before I started laughing my ass off.Me: Lady, if you think I could afford that car on a part time cleaning job, you must be delusional.She then started yelling about how I'm deliberately stopping her leaving, and she's going to have my car towed, but I just walked away. I don't get paid enough to deal with that crap. I have no idea what happened after that, but I really hope the Porsche driver didn't leave for another few hours, just to stick it to her.Edit: hopefully fixed formatting
Ive read a lot of these stories and I finally decided to make my own account and share my experience with one in particular EP and EKOkay so a little backstory, I used to work at McDonald’s when I was a teenager and I’m also deaf but I read lips. I developed bacterial meningitis and became fully deaf at the age of 12. I can still speak since I learned to speak before I became deaf and most of the customers I got there were very understanding, except one.I was working front counter that day as I usually did so I was basically in charge of inside customers. This was the easiest position for me as I could see the customers and read their lips. A middle aged lady and her 9-10 year old son walk in and I say-Me: hi welcome to McDonald’sWhile signing it at the same time. She doesn’t look up and is looking down at her phone so I can’t see her lips and I can’t understand what she’s saying. So I explainMe: excuse me ma’am I’m deaf and I read lips, can you look up for me?She rolls her eyes and I clearly see she says EM: Why would they let a retard work the front counterI am appalled by her behavior but just try to pretend like I didn’t see it. I smile and sayMe: what can I get started for you todayShe starts to patronise me by speaking very very slowly *which fun fact actually makes it 1000x harder to understand what you’re saying* EM: I *pause* want *pause* a *pause* DIET *pause* COKEMe: okay is that all?EM: and a happy meal toyNow all of our drinks are a dollar no matter the size but you have to PAY for a happy meal toy. We don’t just give them out for free. I ring her up and she’s shocked. She demands to know why I’m discriminating against her son and forcing them to pay for a happy meal toy. I really don’t want to cause any trouble and I wish I could say I told her where she could shove it but I ended up just giving her the toy for free. I thought I had avoided conflictBUT OH BOY WAS I WRONGI told her the total was $1.06 and after she paid I handed her a large cup and motioned for the guy behind her to move forward. She waves a hand in my face and points to the drink cupMe: Yes ma’am?EM: you never got me my drink!Now I just thought she didn’t see the machines behind her so I pointed to to drink machine and saidMe: oh there’s a drink station behind you where you can fill up your drink.I kid you not she word for word said EM: thats your job, do I look like I work for McDonald’s?My jaw hit the fucking floor. I had never had someone be so rude in my entire life. I ended up telling her that when you come inside you fill up your own drinks because of sanitary reasons but when she kept on pushing at me I ended up just using our drive thru drink machine to give her the DIET coke. While I’m making the drink my coworker taps me on the shoulder and this is the reason that this is in the EP tag. I see her son making fun of me to his mom by pretending to sign and just in general being a jackass. His mom didn’t punish him or tell him off, instead she encouraged him and started to make fun of me with him. I went to the back and ended up bawling my eyes out. I felt incredibly embarrassed and like I had made a fool of myself by having a disability. I turned in my two weeks notice about a week later and haven’t worked in fast food sinceTo everyone reading this, please be kind to people especially your fast food workers. It’s a tough job even if you don’t have any disability. And if you see people who have disabilities working and trying to make a living, please be patient and help us out by just letting us do our thing and make us feel welcome. Thank you.
This didn't directly happen to me, but I feel like you all will enjoy it anyway. Me and my step-mom were shopping at Macy's and she wanted to try on some clothes, so I sat in the little sitting area inside the giant room that holds all the fitting room cubicles. It was a pretty large area with probably around 12 or so little cubicles going off in two directions with an area in the middle that has a mirror, some clothing racks and some chairs in it, so that's where I was. The way I was seated, my back was to one of the hallways and directly facing the other hallway. Each room had about a foot and a half wide gap at the bottom, so if you knelt down you could see people's feet (Shit, you all know what fitting rooms look like IDK why I'm describing this.) Anyway, my stepmom is in one room in the hallway behind me. EM (entitled mom) and EB (entitled brat) a male child around 2.5-3 years old, are in the fitting room next to hers, and the victim of EM and EB is in a room directly in my line of vision in the other hallway, let's call her MH for 'my hero.'I couldn't really see this part so my stepmom filled me in later when we were comparing notes but apparently EB was being a little shit and EM was grumbling at him to calm the fuck down while she tried on clothes and he thought it would be a great idea to crawl through the gap in the cubicle and enter my stepmom's cubicle instead. I could hear my stepmom saying something like 'Miss, your child is in here,' and the mom continued to yell and grumble at the kid. My stepmom opened her own door, nudged the little shit out and locked her door again. That's when the child slowly entered my field of vision. He toddled down the hall until he got to the very end and then got on his hands and knees and tried to crawl inside MH's cubicle. MH wasn't having it. She starts shouting 'HELLO?? Whoever's kid this is, come get your kid! HELLO?' She is definitely shouting loud enough for EM to hear but EM doesn't do anything. The kid has a shit-eating grin on his face and proceeds to crawl inside the cubicle when I see a large foot press upon his forehead from under the door and gently push him back out."HELLO? Who's kid is this? Come get your kid!"The kid is pissed now and tries crawling inside MH's cubicle again and MH again gently nudges him away with her foot. The kid gets pissed and starts BAAAAAAWWWWING! Throwing a tantrum right there and the fitting room attendant rushes in and looks at me "Is that your kid?" And I just look at her like 'Why the fuck would that be my kid?' and shrug. The fitting room attendant has that 'I'm not paid enough to deal with this shit' look on her face, and asks loudly, "Who's child is this?" and starts peeping under all the cubicles and knocking on all the doors.Fed up with everyone's shit, EM finally bursts out of her fitting room and comes right in the fitting room attendant's (FRA) face and accuses her of "Attacking my kid!"FRA - "I just got here, I was outside returning clothes. I don't know what's going on!"EM - "Then why is my child crying?"FRA - "I don't know!" Then they both turn to look at me.I'm trying not to laugh, but I'm also annoyed at this entitled beast so I get snotty and say "How should I know? I'm not your child's babysitter! All I know is your kid is crawling around harassing women who are simply trying to change their clothes!"EM is building up to a massive "OH HELLL NAWWW!" and getting ready to unleash her rage at me, when MH finally emerges from her fitting room, storms down the aisle, gets in EM's face and shouts "YOU NEED TO CONTROL YOUR FUCKING KID, THIS ENTIRE FUCKING TIME YOU'RE ARGUING WITH PEOPLE THAT LITTLE SHIT IS CRYING IN FRONT OF MY ROOM! YOU NEED TO GO PICK HIM UP OFF THE DAMNED FLOOR! WHAT THE HELL IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?" And then she does that storming off thing where she bangs her shoulder into EM's shoulder on purpose as she leaves, and EM was speechless.That's when my stepmom comes out of her cubicle, stops where EM and FRA are, looks from the crying toddler to EM and back, shakes her head and says "Those floors are so dirty" in that concern-troll voice, and then the two of us skedaddled out of there. Some say EB is still sitting on that floor crying to this day.
Hello, I have this rescue mutt that I adopted after witnessing how a car just abandoned her on the street while still a pupper, because of this circumstances I have no way of knowing how her life was before I adopted her, but she seems to be pretty happy living with me, I let her roam free around the house, and even sleep on my bed, usually she's pretty social whenever someone comes visit. So I was at the vet one day, I had an appointment for just a bimonthly check-up, see if she's growing healthy, etc. While I was in the waiting room this kid comes and shoves a small car toy on my dog's ear, this scares her so much that she pees. So naturally I carried my dog to comfort her, she was still pretty young at this moment. The kid starts whining about how I won't let him play with my dog, and I explained as patiently as I could"The way you used your toy with my dog made her feel uneasy, you have to be respectful and kind to other dogs because they're just like us"Enter, entitled mother. The mother started complaining about how I was being selfish not letting a "MUTT" play with her kid, she said it as if the fact my dog was a mutt somehow lowered her value as a living being. I explained to the mother that her kid shoved a toy car on my dog's ear, to which the entitled mother just replied."So what? your dog isn't well trained, dogs should be able to withstand anything kids do to them, young kids just think of dogs as toys"I was going to say something when the vet came out of the office to see what was going on. Apparently the entitled mother came to adopt a rescue dog from the vet.To which the vet replied "Unless I see commitment from your part to educate your kid on respecting animals, I'm afraid I can't let you adopt any pet. Most of the pets we have for adoption here come from abusive households and we won't let them be adopted by someone who sees them as objects for her child to toy with"At this point the entitled mother was just furious"I promised my son that I would get him a dog if he studied hard, he deserves it"To which the vet replied "No pet deserves to be threaten like a toy by a kid while the parents fail to educate their kid about respecting animals, my decision is final, you cannot adopt any pet from here"The kid was crying but neither the vet or any employee neither myself cared at all, it was clear that the mother just wanted to give the dog to her kid as if it was a new toy. The mother complained about how we ruined her kid's childhood and left extremely upset. Here is a photo of my happy dog. https://i.redd.it/qbemi5ev8md21.jpg
Background:I just recently had a new family move into my neighborhood. The neighborhood is relatively small and close knit. The kind of neighborhood where everyone knows each other and we generally all get along well. We have big block parties and shoot off fireworks together on holidays. The new family is a middle-aged couple with their four children. The kids ages range from around 14 to 2. This incident is just the first of several problems that I have had with this family since they moved in.EM- Crazy MotherK1- One of her kids around 14 years oldMe- The one and only meI was hanging out in the living room just relaxing and watching tv. From the couch I have a clear view into my backyard. That’s when I notice the retractable cover of my swimming pool begin to roll up. I was home alone and no one else that has access to my backyard. For insurance reason I have a lock on my back gate because of the pool. The gate always remains locked as we would be liable if anything was to happen in the yard.I rush outside and see what was going on. That’s when I see EM standing next to my pool with her four children. They are dressed in their swimsuits and EM is rolling up the cover of my pool.Me- Excuse me what do you think you’re doing in my backyard?EM- My kids have been well behaved today and they want to go for a swim. I saw that you have a pool so we are going for a dip. Me- This is not a public pool EM and you are on my private property. I need you to get out of my backyard now. I never told you that you are allowed to come on my property without permission.EM- WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? IT IS A VERY HOT DAY AND MY KIDS WANT TO GO FOR A SWIM AND THEY WILL.Me- Not in my private pool they will not. How did you even get in my yard anyway? The gate is locked.EM- FUCK OFF! IN MY OLD NEIGHBORHOOD WE DID THIS ALL THE TIME. MY KIDS ARE GOING FOR A SWIM NOW AND YOU WILL NOT EVEN KNOW WE ARE HERE. YOU ARE JUST BEING SELFISH AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY BABIES TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF YOUR BAD MOOD.Me (Now angry) – I will not ask again EM. You either get the hell off my property now or I will call the police. You are not using my pool and that is final.EM (finally gets the cover off)- Okay kids jump on in. Don’t listen to this stupid b***h.K1- Yeah you stupid b***h. We are going for a swim now and you can’t stop us.Me- THAT IT! I AM CALLING THE POLICE.EM now sees that I am serious and tries to the “reason” with me.EM- You would really not allow four kids to go for a swim on a hot day. What kind of heartless person are you? Just let us go swimming for an hour and we will leave. Don’t you want to be a good neighbor to us?Me- No I do not. You just broke into my backyard without permission? Please get off my property now.EM starts to mumble something to her kids and then she grabs her two youngest kids and starts to walk out of my yard. I then turn around and see her two oldest boys still standing by the pool. I start to walk over to tell them to go with EM and that’s when I see what they are doing. Her two oldest hell spawns are PEEING into my pool.K1- MAYBE THAT WILL TEACH YOU TO BE A BETTER NEIGHBOR YOU STUPID B***H.Me (grabs the arms of the two oldest and pushes them out the gate)- GET THE FUCK OFF MY PROPERTY YOU DISGUSTING LITTLE SHITS.EM- DON’T YOU DARE LAY A HAND ON MY BABIES OR I WILL CALL THE POLICE ON YOU. WHO DO YOU THINK THEY WILL BELIEVE? A GOOD MOMMY OR A PATHETIC LITTLE B***H LIKE YOU. YOU JUST GOT WHAT YOU DESERVE. ENJOY SWIMMING IN YOUR PISS POOL.They than all walk off laughing as they went back to their house. I was in complete shock and I didn’t know what to do. I now wish I called the police after this first incident, but I sadly did not and things have since escalated with this family.Remember how I said that I had a lock on the gate? I later found it broken on the ground. I have no idea what they used to smash it, but they were successful. I have since purchased a much more heavy-duty lock.Edit 1:Wow I cannot believe how much this has blown up. I didn’t really expect this kind of response.I am going to post more about my experience with the EM as this has been a on going thing. I will also call the police to file a report. I think many of you are right about that one and it is better safe than sorry. I believe some of my other neighbours may have already called the police on EM as well. Edit 2:A lot of people keep asking why i didn’t just call the police right away. I am not the best with confrontation and have a hard time handling stuff like this. When people yell at me I sometimes just shut down and panic. At the beginning of this incident I really thought that EM had the wrong backyard since she is new. A few of my other neighbours have pools as well and I thought maybe one of them had offered EM use of their pool. Many of my neighbours are very friendly and are the type to offer this kind of thing. I thought maybe EM had just got the wrong yard. Boy was I wrong. After the altercation happened I was just to scared to call. I did lay hands on her kids and I was worried I would get into trouble for this. I did not think it would escalate the way it did. I didn’t think anyone could be this crazy.Also yes this post is unfortunately real. I wish it was fake. It would have saved me a lot of time, money and tears.Edit 3:A huge thanks to whoever sent me the platinum, the gold and the three silvers. That was truly amazing of you. You are all the best! I promise I am going to post again very soon. Work just has me extremely busy at the moment. I am hoping to post again in a few days.Update:As promised here is my first update [Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/cceop7/update_em_breaks_into_my_backyard_to_use_my_pool/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck, I am livid. Fucking livid. So, i woke up at 6:30 AM to place my Mother’s Day card and her gift on her bed while she and my father were eating downstairs. So after placing the things on her bed, I head back to my own bed to sleep and wait for her to find the gift on her own. Meanwhile, I hear My parents arguing downstairs about god knows what. Not my problem, right? I head off to dreamland, but I am woken up by angry footsteps stomping up the stairs and my mother swinging my door open.Mom: do you even appreciate me? Do you love me?Me: yes. Did you check your bed?Mom: there’s nothing there. You didn’t do anything for me today? Not even write me a card?Me: I wrote you a card and got you something special. I left them on your bed. This causes her to check her bed again.Mom: you are a liar and a horrible daughter!Me, now looking around her room for the gift: I don’t know where they went? I promise I left them right here.Mom, crying: your father finally gave me a nice present after all of these years! And this is the first year I don’t receive shit from you! So I take it upon myself to investigate every part of her room—no gift. I head downstairs to ask my father whether he has seen my gift, and there he fucking sits, hunched over the kitchen table eating his cereal. ED= entitles dadED: hey honey.Me: can you help me look for mom’s gift? I left it on her bed but now it’s gone, I think the cat might have grabbed it or something.ED, whispering now: actually honey, I took your gift. *sheepish grin* I forgot to get her something this year, so I gave her your gift. But I’ll get you something really nice today from that bookstore you like to make it up to you babe.Me: you—you what? That wasn’t your gift! That was mine ! I’m going to tell her what you did!Dad: no the hell you won’t. Why would you cause a big fight on a happy day? Don’t cause fighting, and I’ll buy you something nice to make up for the gift.  At this point, I don’t fucking care. I bolt upstairs with the gift in my hand and give it to my crying mother. I explain to her what my dad did, and that this gift was from me and not him. So this escalated into a gigantic yelling match between the two of them. TLDR: My dad is an asshole.ATTENTION ATTENTION, I HAVE A HOT HOT UPDATE: HE FUCKING BOUGHT HER THIS $200 SLIMMING TEA, **MID-ARGUMENT** !! WOW ! FUCKING OUTSTANDING MOVE ! Shit has hit the fucking ceiling now.Update #2: they reconciled but it was like a, “My mom feels helpless because my dad won’t stop saying sorry until she says “I forgive you”, so it’s a “reconciliation” in a sense but at the same time it’s really not.UPDATE #3: he came into my room and asked for forgiveness. I figure I will eventually forgive him. What are your thoughts**Here is a big fat edit to the disbelieving redditors:**1. My handwriting is nearly identical to my fathers. It is hard to find any distinction between the two, if you looked at them side by side for comparison. So it is pretty easy to believe that something my dad wrote was written by me, and vice versa. 2. I coincidentally did not leave any signs that acknowledged me as the sender. I just wrote her a poem inside a card that addressed her in third person (such as: A mother is beautiful, kind, and intelligent... etc) so I didn’t leave a, “love, eyeballjupe” or a “dear mom” in the greeting and closing. But here’s the  funny thing: I am the only one in this household that writes poetry! My dad has never written poetry in his life. You would think that would be enough to signal a red flag in my mom’s mind, but I suspect she was just so overjoyed at such sweet words coming from her not so sweet husband that she didn’t question the validity of the poem? These are just guesses. For the record, I’m just as stunned as you all are that she believed my dad wrote the poem and gave her a pair of earrings—not her English loving and fashion forward daughter.
Alright boys and girls, this seem super unbelievable, but when you have been working in the pet trade as a sales associate for long enough in weird areas you start to see your fair share of entitled kids and shitstain parents. My first of many stories so don't be too harsh.For context I work at a mom and pop pet store in the eastern US, and while my expertise is in aquatics, I try to be a jack of all trades. The day that this happened was rather uneventful until this point, all up until Little Shit (LS) and Pig Fucker (PF) entered the store. My store was pretty modest so it was fairly easy to see customers come in and out, especially in the fish department so I got first look at this magnificent creatures, a 40 something year old woman talking on her cell, her hair obviously died blonde and outfit practically screaming "midlife crisis" while her child was in tow. The kid must have been 7 or 8, the kid playing on his Switch, his shirt covered in what looked like a mixture of pizza sauce, soda, and plenty of mystery stains. At first things were pretty normal, the kid originally not caring about anything in the store while PF was getting enraged at him for not paying attention, though that changed rather fast. PF and LS were near the ferrets when PF took LS's switch, immediately causing a reaction of screaming and pouting before being distracted by some of the fish over in my department.Alright, a bit of unnecessary information, but the way my store's fish department is set up is that 2/5ths of it is freshwater, 2/5ths is equipment, and the rest is saltwater. Given we weren't really known for saltwater we only kept pretty generic yet sought after fish like hippo tangs, various clownfish, six-line wrasses, ect. The thing about the first two is because of Finding Nemo, kids are always drawn to the "Dorys" or "Nemos". Alright, that all in mind the first thing LS did was head over to the small assortment of hippo tangs we had, practically pressing his shit covered face against the glass as he yelled out "Dory!" as loud as he could. PF hailed me down from algae scrubbing and this started the encounter. I like to act casual around the workplace as I find it lowers any sort of anxiety a customer has and makes me way more approachable. First thing out of my mouth wasMe: "Hey there, how's your night going? Need help with something?"PF started out our encounter with a roll of the eyes before pointing to the tang and demanding a price with a simple but rudePF: "How much for this thing?"(was the way she said it that was rude).After shifting gears from a casual standing to a more professional one I simply told her that the tang was $160 (he was a good size tang). Of course she scoffed but what came next was a bit more worrying. PF pulled out $30 from her purse and placed it on the desk we use to bag fish, saying in a aggravated tonePF:"That's all you're getting, bag him."Things start to go poorly from here. Its worth noting that it was 9:15 at this point, the store having closed 15 minutes ago, though we make it a policy not to ask customers to leave until 9:30. It was just my manager and myself at this point, my manager in the office closing down registers, so essentially it was like I was the only employee in the store. Seeing PF placing the $30 on the table I raised and eyebrow before leaning against the wall, simply asking herMe: "Do you have a saltwater tank?"She didn't take this well. She screamed without a second passing.PF: "None of your fucking business, now bag my fish you cocky little shit"I simply refused and slide her $30 back towards her before she slid it back, now more pissed off.PF:"I'm going to get your ass fired if you don't bag my fish right now!"At this LS was getting pissed at the interaction, screaming like a banshee about how he wanted the tang, still referring to it as Dory and beginning to stomp his feet in a tantrum. Soon enough I was asking them to leave.So this is where I fucked up, I should have called the cops at this point knowing that she wasn't going to leave without a fight. LS was on the floor at this point, pounding his fists to the floor as snot dripped down his face as PF tried to guilt me.PF: "Sorry sweetie, this guy doesn't want you to have the fish, he's perfectly fine with you having no fish friend to make you happy."At this point she turned back up to mePF:"Do you see what you did, you stupid fuck? You are breaking my angel's heart because you're being too much of a Jew to sell me the fish."Internally I was laughing, this kind of situation happened now and again, but the antisemitism was a new one. I had figured everything was starting to resolve at this point, though I was mistaken. LS. Flipped. Shit.You know how some opera singers can break glass with their voice? This kid would have a knack for something like that. LS was screaming as loud as humanly possible at this point as he managed to reach into the tank. At last my manager had made his way out of the office and watching what was going on. LS grabbed a piece of live rock, accidentally grabbing a longspine urchin. Angry screaming turned right to wails of pain as he pulled a rock out of the tank, a poor little pompom crab in tow. At this point I was less focused on the kid but more focused on making sure my manager was calling 911, which he did. When I turned around I saw something that still gives me nightmares to this day. The kid had been clutching his hand while his mother tried to help him, something hanging out of his mouth. The poor little pompom crab had been crushed by the kid, LS having shoved it into his mouth and chomping down on it, leaving a little claw hanging out of his mouth.The next two minutes was a strange combination of astonishment and panic, myself telling the kid not to move his hand since he would break the spines of the urchin while PF began hitting me with her crappy purse screaming that I hurt her kid.Me:"Your kid shoved his hand into a tank, one with toxic animals nonetheless (foxface rabbitfish) and did this to himself, calm the fuck down and leave him alone so when the paramedics get here they can get the spines out."PF:"HOW DARE YOU!? YOU EXPECT ME TO LET MY ANGEL SUFFER? IF YOU JUST SOLD ME THE STUPID FISH THIS WOULD HAVE NEVER OF HAPPENED?"Me:"Your kid reached into the tank and ate a crab, what the fuck did you teach this kid?"PF:"DON'T YOU EVER, EVER TELL ME HOW TO RAISE MY ANGEL! HE HAD THE RIGHT TO EAT THAT CRAB, YOU TOOK SOMETHING FROM HIM AND HE TOOK SOMETHING FROM YOU."By the end of this interaction the paramedics had arrived, restraining the kid and taking him into an ambulance as the police tried to sort things out. Unsurprisingly PF tried to pin everything on me, saying I threw and urchin at him (Wtf?) and he ate the crab in a panic. Equally unsurprisingly we had the entire thing on CCTV, including PF hitting me with her purse. Long story short, PF was arrested for aggravated assault as apparently she had stuffed the rock into her bag to give it the extra punch. Didn't notice until after the paramedics saw me that I was bleeding on my leg from the jagged live rock. After getting a statement the cops left, PF and LS going off to where ever the hell the cops took them and I got out of everything with 8 stitches and a $300 bonus from my boss for handling the situation without anyone getting seriously injured. From what I ended up hearing, the kid had actually got stung by the foxface's dorsal spines and that sent him into a blind rage. The mom got a plea deal and she ended up with a huge fine, some jail time, and some other shit.In summery, I didn't sell a EM a fish, kid flipped shit, grabbed an urchin and ate a crab, EM got arrested for assault. This was by far the worst situation I had ever had in the store and I still can't believe the outcome of this till this day. This was three years ago now, I was in work the other day when I say a pouting kid over a mom not let him get a hippo tank and this has been brought to the front of my mind ever since.EDIT: At work at the moment, gonna try to find out what happened from my boss later. Just noticed an inconsistency with the timeline, switch wasn't out yet. I personally always remember it as a switch, though given the circumstances there is a big chance that it was an ipad or something similar in shape. Gonna leave this here just so every knows. Also, thanks a shitton for the silver!EDIT: So a lot of you guys have been asking about what ended up happening to PF and LS, I had sat down with my boss this morning and asked about the events and while I didn't get all the answers I was looking for, this is what he had to say. As I've stated, I still stay up now and again wondering what could make people act this way and I did get a few answers. According to my boss, the woman PF was the wife of a known meth dealer, which didn't exactly surprise me given what happens in my town. The cops never had gotten a warrant to search their property for whatever reason, but this had given them the opportunity. From what he was told me the woman was abusing prescription anti-depressants and drugs for ADD and had, had a meltdown. Although I pressed charges I never was called to court and from what we could assume, PF most likely struck a deal with the police to rat out her husband. I don't know the story with LS, though it wouldn't surprise me if he was on the same toxic cocktail of drugs. In regards to the CCTV footage, he had told me that he handed it over to the police and couldn't show me for "legal reasons" but that there wasn't much to see other than my manager running to the sales floor. The way our CCTV cams are placed only really show part of the sales floor, the office, and the register counter. Medical bills was way easier, I have been on an expensive med not covered by most insurances for most of my life so I've always had to pay out the ass for a really good insurance company and this time it paid off. I ended up with a $100 charge for the ambulance, though my boss reimbursed me. Honestly this was just a really surreal situation and it has really confused me for a while, but I'm pretty happy I got things cleared up, hopefully PF is rotting in jail and LS is getting the love and direction he should have been getting all along.Also, holy shit guys, thanks for the gold!
**This is going to be a long post, as I have to detail several years of EP behavior by my aunt in order to justify the retribution exacted by my cousin.  TL; DR at the end.**&#x200B;*Backstory*My mom is the oldest of four children and gave birth to me a few months before her youngest sister **(let's call her Cruella)** gave birth to my cousin **(Maleficient).** From the day she brought Maleficient home, Cruella groomed my cousin to be a beauty pageant kid. She started getting Maleficient's hair done as soon as she could and raised Maleficient to only wear dresses and very dainty shoes. [When I briefly lived with my aunt, she used the money my mom sent home to provide for my care to get Maleficient new clothes and hair.](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/b1t0iv/entitled_aunt_used_me_as_a_check_so_my_mom_told/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) Cruella had a full-time job as a grocery store cashier and also received child support from Maleficient's father, who was in the US Air Force, but she spent thousands of dollars on making sure her daughter was always beauty pageant ready.&#x200B;When we got older, I was a grade level ahead of Maleficient. Cruella made Maleficient compete with me academically regardless of the difference in our classes. We were both good students and lived in different states, but Cruella would call my mom once a month and would ask detailed questions about my report cards. If Mom told her that I earned all A's, Cruella would implement various punishments until Maleficient had just as good or better grades. At first, Cruella would belittle her own daughter with taunts. Then she would deny buying Maleficient any cookies, toys, etc., until her grades "improved." When we started hitting our growth spurts, Cruella would make Maleficient wear old dresses and shoes that were **way** too small until her grades "improved."&#x200B;Naturally, this made life difficult for me and my mom. Maleficient grew to resent me and she often did petty things to get me into trouble, like breaking my grandma's doll collection, breaking dishes, and even fought me a couple of times when I refused to be bullied. Mom stopped discussing my grades with Cruella, which worked until Mom and I moved back to her hometown (where Cruella lived) and enrolled in the same school as Maleficient. Then Cruella began to "volunteer" at the school on report card days just to find out what my grades and Maleficient's grades were. This continued into our college years.&#x200B;I ended up dropping out of college after three semesters as I had developed a drinking problem. I had to undergo a few months of treatment. Maleficient was enrolled in college by this time, and Cruella maintained her streak of competition by calling my mom to report how well my cousin was doing before snidely pointing out that I was no longer in college. I changed phone numbers after Cruella called me one day to tell me that Maleficient was applying for study abroad *then* asked how my "borderline minimum wage" retail job was going. The irony was that Maleficient would end up being a fourth year junior in college when I finally returned to college. More on that later.&#x200B;By the time I returned to college, our grandma (Mom and Cruella's mom) was in a nursing home due to dementia-related problems. She had been diagnosed while we were in high school but the disease was progressing rapidly. Mom, being the eldest child, quit her job to spend every day at the nursing home, talking to grandma, reading to grandma, etc. Mom wanted to have grandma returned to grandma's home, but Cruella refused. Cruella had secured power of executor of the estate shortly after grandma's diagnosis, meaning that she had the ability to place Grandma in the home despite her siblings' protests. It also meant that Cruella technically had ownership of Grandma's home and the land on which it sat.&#x200B;Fast forward a couple of years: Maleficient began dating a local pastor's son **(let's call him Charming)** and they got engaged in April, after dating for three months. Cruella, coincidentally, was good friends of Charming's mother.  Cruella wasted no time in bragging to my mom how Maleficient was engaged to be married. At this time, I was graduating from college, which really got under Cruella's skin. I still didn't talk directly to her but I did keep up communication with my cousin.&#x200B;When I talked to her about the upcoming wedding, Maleficient revealed that Cruella was planning to take Grandma off life support and would use the money from Grandma's estate and insurance to pay for a lavish wedding. Maleficient also revealed that she did not want to marry Charming, was fed up with college (she was a seventh year senior), basically living the life Cruella had created for her. I mentioned to my mom what Maleficient had said about taking Grandma off life support, and Mom was **livid.** She called Maleficient and they crafted the revenge together.&#x200B;*Revenge:*In June, Cruella decided to host a very over the top party to celebrate the engagement. Mom and I chose not to attend as we chose to visit Grandma in the hospital together that night. So Maleficient's actions were reported to me by Maleficient herself, but I'm going to phrase them.&#x200B;Cruella had organized the evening so that the parents of the engaged couple and the engaged couple could stand to tell everyone in the room how amazing their respective families were. Charming and his parents had already gushed their praises for Cruella, and it was Maleficient's turn. Maleficient thanked Cruella for raising her, thanked Charming's parents for raising such a good son....*then announced that the wedding was off.* She took the opportunity to tell Charming that she did care about him but would not marry him just because it was what their families expected from *soon to be parents.* Maleficient then left the party and spent the night with one of her friends from high school.&#x200B;This humiliated Cruella on a personal and financial level. She had already paid non-refundable deposits for a caterer, wedding reception hall, dress, limo, etc., and she was out of hundreds of dollars. Furthermore, Cruella and Charming's parents were very against premarital sex, which made Maleficient's unexpected announcement even more appalling. Cruella had planned to keep the pregnancy as hidden as possible with the dress she had selected, the floral arrangement, etc., and Maleficient was expected to remain complicit. She called Maleficient and raged at her several times, but Maleficient stood her ground. She returned the car Cruella had bought for her and informed Cruella that she was dropping out of college as well, which would leave Cruella *thousands of dollars in debt on student loans.*&#x200B;Their drama took a back seat when Grandma passed away in early August. Maleficient had gotten a job in a corporate office by then, and showed up to the funeral looking very happy and very pregnant. After the funeral, we had a reception and Cruella called Mom, me, Maleficient, and my uncle and other aunt into a room together to announce that she was going to sell Grandma's house and land, and would split up Grandma's life insurance policy money as she saw fit. It was the expected announcement from her and she phrased it as something Grandma would have wanted.&#x200B;I don't know who was smiling bigger, Mom or Maleficient, when they announced that they were contesting her power as executor of the estate. As Grandma's diagnosis of dementia had been announced just days before Cruella secured her position, Mom had consulted a lawyer to contest the decisions Cruella had made. Mom and Cruella ended up going to court and the matter was resolved less than a year later: Cruella's position as executor of the estate was overruled due to Grandma's mental capacity at the time. This meant that, outside of a life insurance policy Cruella had taken on Grandma, she received no money directly. Maleficient is paying on her student loans but Cruella is still paying off other debts from living beyond her means. Mom agreed to let Maleficient and her daughter move into Grandma's old house, and she and Charming are co-parenting.&#x200B;**TL; DR: My aunt was an abusive, manipulative nut; her daughter felt she could not make the cut. But when she got older, she also became bolder. Now auntie is stuck in a sad little rut.**&#x200B;**UPDATE: I just want to let anyone who commented know that my cousin really appreciated the comments and feedback this post got. She is not a member of Reddit and does not want to be, but she was really, really happy that so many people were supportive of her ordeal. Thank you everyone for your thoughts.**
DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVE A WEAK STOMACH!!!!!!!!Consider yourself warned.Okay, among my many vices (gaming, etc) one that I have had for many years is my addiction to nicotine.  Now, I'm not a smoker.  Honestly, I hate the smell of all forms of smoke. I use smokeless tobacco, better known as "snuff", "chew", or "dip" depending on where you are in the nation.  When you use this stuff, you spit... sometimes quite a lot.  Because of that, I've had this habit of keeping old soda bottles handy. That way, I can spit in the bottle and seal it.  No worry about accidentally spilling it and making a mess.  This has also the effect of, sometimes,  making it easy to hide what I am doing.I never expected that it'd cause trouble though.  Trouble, and humor.So, couple years back I was taking a cross country trip by bus.  About halfway to my destination, at a lay over in Denver, I had the following encounter: Dramatis Personae:  EK:  entitled kid, TM: tired mom, ME:  Me.ME: (taking a seat outside the bus station at a nearby store. As I sit down, I put my half full spit bottle beside me and start checking my phone.)EK: (Pointing at bottle)  Gibs me dat.ME: What? Huh?  Oh... no, you don't want that.EK:  I want it, Gib it to me. (yes, the kid actually said "gib")ME: No, now shove off kid.About this time, the kid ran over to his mother and said something.  The lady came over my way and seemed nice, if very tired. Long bus rides will do that.TM: My boy says you won't give him the rest of your soda.ME:  It's not so...TM:  I know full well what it is. Why don't you just you know... give it to him?ME: But...TM: Just give it to him.At this point, I just shrug, gesturing at the bottle.  The liquid in it was dark as cola, though it sure as hell wouldn't be as tasty.  Mom smiled and thanked me, taking the bottle and walking back over to her hellspawn.  I decided to hang around and watch everything.  The kid turns to me, flips me the bird, and then makes a show of opening the bottle and taking a BIG gulp out of it.You could see his brain suddenly short circuit.  Gag reflex kicked in, along with the sudden need to swallow.  I could tell that his mind was fighting with itself.  Eyes the size of saucers, the gag reflex won and he blew the liquid out all over the front of his shirt, then pants. Then he started to dry heave.  Turned several interesting shades of color too. All the while, the mom was watching him, patting his back.  Eventually she carried him off in the direction of the rest room to be cleaned up.  That kid looked like he'd never trust a coke ever again.I ended up speaking to the lady later, while we all were on the bus.  Apparently, the grandmum had seriously spoiled the kid, giving him anything and everything he wanted.  Mom, for her part, was trying to teach him that the world didn't work that way.I think her little stunt with my spit bottle made a point.
So this happened a couple of years ago but it still just hurts. My Dad and I have never really seen eye to eye. He grew up with no sisters and an awful mother figure and none of his friends have daughters, only sons. I don’t blame him for struggling to raise a girl when he had absolutely no reference point but he didn’t need to show blatant favouritism towards my brother.I’ve always been the black sheep a little. My parents and younger brother have always been this nice little trio, my brother is a Mummy’s boy but Dad dotes on him regardless. He’s four years younger than me, I’m 18 he’s 14. I’ve struggled to find my place in the family, even my standing as which sibling I am isn’t certain because my Dad accidentally impregnated a girl at 19, had my half-brother, and I was born 14 years later. My older brother was enough in my life that I don’t feel like the oldest child but not enough to feel like the middle, I’m just Dad’s retrial at parenting and my brother is the beneficiary of all his practise.Now aside from that little rant, the actual story.My brother and I are very musical, I play a multitude of instruments, he just plays saxophone, and he’s good, always has been. He suffered classic younger sibling syndrome, we were in a much better financial position when I began playing clarinet that I got a really good beginner-intermediate model that I still play today. When he started about four years later things had gotten tight, so he had to rent his from the local concert band, and it wasn’t great. Originally it was fine because my parents didn’t want to invest in something he might not commit to but he did and loved it.At this point I was 15, and I’d been working for two years at a local sports club, earning less than minimum wage because I was underage, working my butt off and saving a pretty hefty percentage of my income. My father, who felt responsible for my job since he knew the owner but I’d actually gotten the job myself, decided he was entitled to my savings, about $500 at the time. His exact words were ‘We could use your savings to buy your brother a better saxophone’God it crushed me. First of all you cannot get a sax better than the one he has for only $500. Secondly, what kind of father asks one child to give up practically two years of work for another? It made me feel like he had more pride or hope for his son that his daughter’s savings should contribute towards it, even though at the time I was saving for a student level clarinet and he knew that. He never offered to pay the money back or anything and thankfully, after I asked Mum what she thought of it and she lost her mind, it was never brought up again, though he has asked for my savings since then and I’ve said no.Can’t wait to move out next year.EDIT: So I should make a couple of things clear.My father didn’t actually take the money, Mum shut that situation down real quick, but it didn’t stop him from asking and trying to manipulate me into giving them up for a long time.I live in New Zealand, and my accounts have been in my name since I was 13. My parents have just as much right to them as the stranger across the street. Absolute zero. Credit isn’t really a thing here so that’s not an issue either.Can’t believe all the attention this got and thanks for all the advice.EDIT #2:I have half a year of high school left and then next year I’m moving eight hours away to university, so that’s where my savings are going, I can’t move out now.Also to explain the minimum wage situation, in New Zealand minimum wage is $17.70, and it tends to go up every year. However you don’t have to pay minimum wage to employees under the age of 16, you can pay them whatever you want. I started on $10 an hour at age 13, and nearly a year into the job I went up to $14.25 as that was the current minimum wage, and that’s where my wage stayed until I turned 16 even when the minimum wage rose.EDIT #3:Don’t appreciate the attacks I’m receiving about how much I had in savings after two years. That isn’t what this post about.
A few things first. 1) This is my first post on here, 2) I'm finnish, english ain't exactly my first language and 3) Formatting? Never heard of it. Anyways, on to the story, I guess.EDIT: There’s a typo in the title, it’s supposed to say his instead of her. So to clarify, Ek is a BOY and the main leader/master/whatever is a WOMAN. &#x200B;So this happened like 9-10 years ago when I was 7 or 8 years old. I was a scout back then and a part of a group which was, for the most part, filled with friends and people I knew. I was popular, because back then I was social and easy going. I was friends with everyone and everyone was friends with me and everyone else. But, as always, there's one exception to this.&#x200B;In all honesty, EK was a goddamn dumbass. He would yell, he would fight, he would make others cry. He did what he wanted. Back then I thought he was special ed and that's why I tried to be friends with him but nope, later in life, when we went to the same high school I learned that he was just... dumb. Like I said, that kid was a dumbass and would always be trying to get into fights with everyone. People were sick of it and in time, so was I.I don't remember clearly what the bastard did to deserve a shouting from me (he was propably harassing girls or hitting boys) but I fucking flipped on him. Now, at this time, he didn't take out his knife or begin to cry, instead, he just stopped shouting and stopped whatever the hell he was doing. For the rest of the day he would just sit at the back of our cabin and just stare at me, menacingly.&#x200B;So, let's skip a week ahead in time. It was the next scout "session" (don't know what else to call it) and things were going well. We were doing something time consuming, so everyones attention was at the thing they were doing, whatever that was. EK, of course, wasn't doing anything and instead he decided it was better to run around the cabin. Scout master/leader tried her best to stop the madness but that only fuelled EKs rampage. While on his rampage, it didn't take long for him to find the door to the log cabin that was next to the main cabin and when he did, well, shit hit the fan, HARD. I was sitting next to the cabin and I could hear everything he did and said there clearly.&#x200B;EK: "Oh my!"He started whispering from the log cabin.EK: "Ay Joel (me), come here for a sec!"At first I thought: "What the hell is he doing now?" but I soon became curious. He wouldn't stop whispering and I kind of wanted to know what the bugger had found. So, like stupid goddamn kid I was, I went there.Me: "Yeah? What is it?"EK: "I got something to show you?"After a bit of searching, I found him at the back of the cabin.Now, at this time, I thought he was going to apologize for being a dick to everyone and I was quite extatic. I knew this would be a story I would milk the shit out of, something to brag to my friends. "I was so intimidating that he apologized to ME!" Well, I got a story out of it, but not the one I was hoping...Me: "What's ya got there, buddy?" His back was turned against me and I didn't see what he was hiding or doing. After I asked him what he was doing, he turned around.EK: "You see this, Joel?"I couldn't see what he had in his hand but I saw his twisted grin.Me: "I can't see it, could you bring it closer?"EK: "Sure!"And now I saw it, a dull, red handle knife.EK: "Do you see it now, Joel?"Now, at this point I said something along the lines of "oh shit" or "what the fuck" and booked it outta there, with the fucker laughing maniacly behind me. I ran out of the log cabin in to the main cabin and tripped. This diverted the leaders attention, who now noticed that EK was gone and that I was on the cabin floor, panicking.Leader (L): "What's wrong Joel? Where's EK?"Me: "It's EK, that wankers got a knife (yep, I said wanker, that one I remember vividly)"L: "What?"Me: "He's trying to gut me!"It took a moment for the leader to realise what was happening but when she did, she ran into the log cabin, fuming.My friends came closer and asked me what had happened but before I could answer them, I heard the leader scream at EK.L: "What makes you think it's okay to threaten someone with a knife!?"EK: "I wasn't I was just showing it!"L: "Well what makes you think you have any right to hold one without a supervisor! You could have not only hurt yourself, you could have hurt Joel!"EK: "I swear, I..."L: "Get out of here. Go outside and wait for your mom to come pick you up!"She then came back into the main cabin and told one of the other leaders to look after us. She then went outside with EK and waited for the mother to come pick the little devil up. Now, according to what I had heard the leader tell the others after this incident, the mother was fucking furious. A complete and utter EM, who tried to tell the leader that I was propably the aggressor and that I was a goddamn son of a bitch. At the time I laughed at this with my friends but had I known she would come for me the next week, I wouldn't have been laughing. &#x200B;In order for you guys to understand better where me and my friends were when this happened, [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Turuntie+8,+31400+Somero/@60.633554,23.5088811,3a,75y,188.35h,84.57t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s79CyquNO-dR95NiZVotpcQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m5!3m4!1s0x468c2f166f103921:0xa54209e8adf40fa7!8m2!3d60.6330881!4d23.5087221) is the main cabin.Now, a week after the incident, me and my friends were on top of the "bridge" you can see in front of the building. We were fucking around, doing dumb stuff, playing tag, stuff like that when suddenly, EM shows up.The conversation goes something like this:EM: "Which one of you is Joel?"Me: "Here ma'am."EM: "You! You're the one who bullied my darling!"Me: "What?"I then noticed EK on the backseat, bawling his eyes out.Me: "Oh, you're EKs mom... yeah, he tried to slice me with a knife"EM: "hE WoUlD NevER!"She then went on to list some positive things about him, which seemed pretty bullshit to me and my friends."He's a gentleman!" Yet he harassed little girls."He's great at school!" Yet he couldn't be bothered to pay attention for a single second (that and he was a F and D student in High School so...)."He's got more friends than any of you!" Yet he had somehow become an outcast in our scout group.I honestly got bored at her rambling and went back to playing with my friends. Some of them kept shouting at her, others ignored here. One of my friends, a girl I had known since kindergarten started straight up roasting this 30 year old woman. I can't remember what she shouted but I remember EMs reaction.EM: "Shut up you bitch, this ain't none of your business."Now this didn't stop my friend, in fact, it fuelled her rage even more. Knowing what kind of woman her mother was, this didn't suprise me one bit.As time went on, one of the leaders noticed the commotion and came to check what's going on. EM noticed this and got out of there, *FAST*! After the leader asked us, what had happened and we told him, he went and told the main leader and she was furious. She went and straight up banned EK, a ban which was lifted just 3 years ago in 2016, when EK wanted back into the scout group. My career as a scout had already came to an end in 2011, so it didn't bother me, until I started it again in the autumn of 2016 and had to cope with the dumbass AGAIN. But, that's a story for another time folks (if you want more, of course).
No real damage done but it was still annoying. A cousin of mine recently got into Studio Ghibli films. He wanted to borrow Spirited Away and I was okay with that. His folks go to a church in my area so they agreed to swing by and grab the disk after service. They come in and I go to get the disk. My cousin starts asking about some of the other Ghibli films and anime mixed into my dvd collection. Then he points to Soul Eater. It’s a great show but he just turned thirteen and it wasn’t exactly age appropriate. Plus I didn’t think his parents (mainly his mother) would approve. They’re very religious and the show revolves around soul harvesting, the Grim Reaper, witches, and some fan service. I’m still not sure why Ghibli was okay with them (because of the spirits, witches, and demons) but I was pretty sure a show called Soul Eater would tip that Jenga tower. So when he asked me if he can borrow it, I said no. That “no” seemed to catch my aunt’s attention and she was by my cousin’s side in a flash. She ask why he can’t borrow it and I told her it may not be age appropriate. Then she says something along the lines of “Its a cartoon, it’s meant for children. You’re a grown woman, you shouldn’t have this anyway”. I was a little irritated but stood firm. Instead, I let the kid barrow My Neighbor Totoro as well as Spirited Away and they went home. I thought everything was good until an hour ago. I received a call from my screaming aunt. She accused me of trying to corrupt her son with vulgarity and satanism. I was lost at first and then she mentioned a demon and a naked cat woman being in the first episode. I checked my shelf and Soul Eater was missing. I’m not sure when she did it but she had stolen the box set.  They’re returning the movies next Sunday and Soul Eater had better be with them.  I’m hoping she doesn’t “confiscate” it like she does with other “ungodly” stuff.  That set was around fifty dollars after shipping and handling. It was like THE first anime box set I ever bought and I will go to war for it. Edit: Text SpacingSecond Edit: They agreed to return my DVD’s next Sunday. I’m hoping it will be uneventful but I’ll update then.Third Edit: I’m 26 and live alone. I’m not “getting in trouble” over this. The only reason she thinks she can take my stuff is because she did it when I was a kid. Last Edit: I know Soul Eater isn’t technically inappropriate for a thirteen year old. My judgement was based mainly around his mother’s world view. I grew up in a similar household. When I was a kid, I was banned from watching anime after they caught me watching Bleach. I didn’t want her forbidding him from watching anime because of one series.

Sorry about the layout. This is definitely going to get buried but i thought i'd post it anyway even though it happened a while ago, my memory isn't the best so this is only a basic outline of what was actually said. EK=entitled kidEM=entitled motherT=teacherOP/Me=meOk lets start, for background i went to school with EK a very long time ago and somehow i managed to get on his bad side. EK didn't seem to like me and would use any possible excuse he had to torment me and make school a living hell. Before we started sitting together in this particular class he had already been picking on me for years so i wasn't exited and kinda expected this from him.EK wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed and he often copied other kids answers. I didn't want to make his attitude towards me any worse than it already was so i would just play along and act like i didn't notice him looking over my shoulder, this went on for a while until one day T finally held us both back after class.-This is basically how the conversation went:T: i have noticed both of you are getting similar scores on tests and are writing down the same answers in class, would either of you like to admit to anything?As i didn't want to be called a snitch i kept my mouth shut and hoped this other kid would learn his lesson, but no, thats not how it works apparently.EK: OP has been stealing my answers for months, its sooo annoying!Me: actually its the other way around-T: why didn't you say this before?EK: shes just trying to blame it on me!It basically ended up with me in detention and EK running free because the way it looked was as if he told the truth and i turned the tables on him. We were still sitting next to eachother in class so he continued to copy my work, then it came to the next test...-I had heard something online about someone who got their revenge by ticking all of the answers wrong in pencil then rubbing it out last minute and rewriting them in pen and that is exactly what i did. I ticked every answer far from correct, to an extent where some of the answers were even quite dumb then around 5 minutes to the end of the test i went through again rubbing out my answers and ticking the correct answers in pen, also intentionally covering most of my answers so that he struggled to copy them. EKs expression was a mixture of anger and defeat as he knew he couldn't do anything now, it was priceless.After the test he came up to me looking pale/ worried and asked me why i did it, i acted like i had no idea what he was talking about and he stormed off angrily.We handed in the tests and when they came back i got a decent score as usual and he failed miserably, T even made a comment on how messy it looked when he scribbled out his answers.I bet you think this is the end? No, we're only just getting started. This is EMs time to shine!It wasn't that long after the test, maybe a week or so when me and my parents were called into the school to attend a meeting with T, EK and EM.-This is how it went:T: EM has contacted us about OP 'bullying' EK, OP do you have anything youd like to say?Me: yes, what exactly did i do?EM: you made EK fail his test!T: could you explain how OP managed to do that?EM goes on to explain exactly what i did and T suddenly realised who was really cheating off of who. T: so your kid was cheating? EM: no, he already knew all of the answers anyway, its just a waste of his time! (yes EM actually told T it was a waste of her dumb kids time whilst basically admitting that he cheated) T: but he was copying the answers anyway? EM didn't really have much to say after that. EK was given a detention and left in a huff and i got an apology from T for the detention i was put in. -Unfortunately i don't have a really amazing ending and EK continued to annoy me throughout the rest of my time at that school but heres my story with EK and EM anyway.Edit: i honestly didn't expect this to blow up so much, thank you kind redditors! Also im enjoying watching everyone roasting EK.
Okay so this happened today, like an hour or so ago. A bit of pre-amble, I'm a trans-girl, just got to my family's house to visit for Easter (I rode my motor bike down) and have shortish, pretty deep purple hair.I pulled into a non-brand specific supermarket around the corner from my family's place to pick up an energy drink, and as I got off my bike and removed my helmet I could see out of the corner of my eye this little girl (LG) by the trolley return pointing at me and generally going nuts.I start to walk past to walk inside the store and the LG turns to her mother (our EP) sitting on a bench nearby with an old lay who must be her mother, both having a fag each (cigarette for our international readers).LG: Mummy can I have hair like her? (I rightly assume this was about me)EP: No [LG's name], and that's not a girl.Old Lady: *grunts in approval*I ignore and move in to grab my sweet taurine juice, and because it's easter weekend I'm in there for about 10 minutes or so just in a crowd. As I walk back out the family is still outside, with a lot more fags smoked.LG: But why can't I have pretty hair? (she sounds like she's been doing this non-stop)EP: Because I said so now shut up before I bloody clip you.I start to walk past as the EP waves to catch my attention.EP: Hey mate, why've you got to have hair like that for?Me: oh, uhh because I want it?EP: no but why like that? No man I know has a colour like that, can't you just it take it out?Me: Well I'm not a man, so there's that much, and not without constantly washing my hair for like a couple of days.EP: no I mean like now, can you get it out now?I knew the education in my area was lacking but damn.Me: look I just wanted to grab a drink and get going, let's just leave it *I turn to walk back to my bike and put my helmet back on*EP: fine then you little faggot, go be a shit somewhere else.Old Lady: *grunts in a way that I guess must have been a laugh*The LG was quiet through all this, just looking between the two of us as she cuddles in to her mother. I just had enough, but I didn't want her to feel like she came out on top, so I turn around, still a bit away from them, and reach a hand into my jacket pocket.Me: oh right yeah I'm sorry, here have this apology *pull out my hand and flip them both the bird, smiling and waving my other hand to present my apology*After a second of silence and slack jawed looks from the pair I turn and go back to my bike and start to make way off, as in the background I hear the EP hurling abuse my way about different stuff.Not as fantastical or karma filled as some other stories on this sub, but eh :pEdit: thanks for the gold kind anon, didn't expect anything let alone that quickDouble edit: oho damn, thank you for the plat kind Triple edit: Because of how many times people have asked, the bike I ride is a Keeway RKV
Hi, I this is my first real post so sorry if I'm not doing this quite right.I have my own entitled parent stories but this one happened to my mom when she was pregnant with me.So back in the late nineties when Sears wasn't sad and dying,  my mother was an assistant manager. Her boss was also pregnant and this generally wasn't an issue, until it was.Now my parents spent a long time choosing baby names when I turned out to be a girl, they really wanted my name to be gender neutral to prevent future trouble finding jobs (yes, that is the actual reason), but my middle name remained the same as when they thought I was a boy: Ryan.When they decided on my full name, my mom told her friends about it, and one of them ended up telling the manager.As my mother was on lunch-break this lady storms in, already red and furious, "I heard you were naming your baby Ryan."My mother is of course, stunned. She stays silent for a few moments before finally answering, "That's her middle name, yes?""Your baby is a girl!" The woman exclaims, as though this is some sort of great revelation.My mother nods.Getting somehow redder the woman snaps, "Ryan is a boys name.""Actually it's gender neutral." At this point, my mother's surprise is wearing off into a bit of righteous confusion. "Is there a problem with the name?""You can't name your baby that." The woman is practically shouting at this point, "*I'm* naming my son that!"My mother stares at her, trying to work out what kind of mental gymnastics it takes to decide your choice of baby name should give you the authority to veto someone else's baby name. "So?""Change your baby's middle name or I'm going to fire you." The woman says, having drawn a crowd with this whole scene to witness the utter insanity that was her outburst. People who could act as witnesses for my mother if she attempted such a thing."I don't think you can do that." My mother answers flatly. She couldn't even fire my mother on some other infraction because there was no other infraction; the staff was friendly with my mother and she had brought up sales in her area by *a lot.*The woman stops for a moment, maybe realizing that my mother was right on that point and once again demands, "Change your baby's middle name! I chose Ryan fist!"Ah yes, calling dibs, surely my mother would have to respect a grown woman calling dibs on a very common name."Ryan is my maiden name." My mom answers flatly.At this, the woman stops, still furious, sputters for a moment, and finally stomps off.My middle name is Ryan, my mother's boss named her son Dylan instead.
Alright so, a few warnings: first post, on mobile, etc. blah blah blah. You get it, you’ve seen these stories before. Gonna try to keep it clean.LET US BEGIN!So a few weeks ago I was in a grocery store, right? Nothing unusual. I had a particularly rough day and so I wasn’t in the mood for dressing up, just a blue t-shirt from one of my old schools, shorts, and sneakers. I had just finished getting everything I needed when I got into line. That’s when I saw Ep.Now, this woman only had two things in her cart. Her toddler, a little boy who was probably around 3, and way, WAAYYYY too much booze. I mean like the whole cart section of the cart was absolutely filled with bottles. Also, worth mentioning that this woman (probably mid thirties) was wearing a hot pink CROP TOP. Alright, that’s pretty bad, but it’s not my business and I’m not in the mood to argue with someone. She pays for her things and begins to leave, so I begin to do the same. I’m at the card chip reader when I feel a tap on my shoulder. I turn around, and the trouble begins.Me: hello ma’am, can I help you?Em: yes, I was wondering if you could change your shirt.Me: (dumbfounded) I’m sorry, what?Em: well, blue is not a girls color and I don’t want my son to get the wrong idea about what is acceptable to wear.Me: I’m sorry, I will not be doing that. If you want your son to learn those types of things you can do it at your house, but I’m allowed to wear whatever I feel like wearing.Em: oh, don’t be so unladylike! Just change out of that shirt!Me: I will if you can give me one good reason.Em: blue is not for girls!Me: okay well, crop tops aren’t for witches, but you’re here.At this point I just made sure I had everything and walked away. I heard her mutter something to the cashier as I left but I couldn’t hear her and I honestly don’t care.
This happened a few months ago and it turned out to be longer than j thought when I typed it our. I was flying one of these cheap airlines where the seats are all crammed together so I paid extra for a seat with more legroom which also gave me free priority boarding. Usually don't care for that but when you've got is a cabin bag getting on early so I don't have to keep it under the seat is worth waiting in the plane. After being one of the first people onboard the plane is now pretty much fully boarded. Enter EM: Entitled mom and S: Son about 12 I would guess. I see then talking to a crew member for a while but go back to listening to my music when  I feel a tap on my shoulder so I remove my headphones. S: "Hey I'm flying with my mom and was wondering if you could swap seats with her so we could sit together?"I look over to where his mom is sitting and it's a standard seat. Me: "No I'm sorry. "Kid looks a bit defeated but walks away. I put my headphones in and start to relax when I hear a loud voice. EM: "Excuse me?!"Me: "Yes?"EM: "Me and my son need your seat as he is scared of flying so we need to sit together. "Me: "I'm sorry  to hear that but i paid extra for a seat with extra legroom so i won't be switching to a standard seat. "EP: "You're sitting next to the only open seat, you have to swap with me." Me, starting to get annoyed she won't take no for an answer "No I don't, and if you needed to sit together you should've paid extra to choose your seats not bet that you can switch seats later."EP, clearly starting to get agitated: "I can't afford to pay extra for that, just because you're rich doesn't mean everyone is I'm a parent so I have to save money. Now swap seats. "Not sure how rich I have to be to afford the 5-15€ if costs to select a seat but alright. I'm really starting to get annoyed she won't leave me alone.Me: "I'm not going to swap with you now please leave me alone. "EP, raising her voice even more: "The stewardess said you have to swap so we can sit together now do what she said and move. " I've had enough so I hit the flight crew button and the same woman they were talking to earlier comes over. FC: "How can I help you?" ME: "This lady wants to swap seats with me and she says you told-" I get interrupted by EM now yelling: "He won't move you told us he had to swap seats with us now make him move!"FC, giving me a supportive look and mouths I'm sorry.  She turns to EM: "I told you this is the only open seat so if you want to sit together you could ask him if he is okay with swapping, not that you could force him to move. If he doesn't want to swap with you you will have to go take your assigned seat."EM: "I have to sit next to my son you have to get this retard to move or sit us somewhere else or I'm going to sue you and delay this plane. "FC: "If you had to sit next to each other you should have paid to select seats, now I've had enough of your tone and you will either stop bothering this man and go back to your seat or I will have the captain deplane you." EM looks like she's going to explode, she stands there for a moment before turning around and heading back to her seat mumbling something. The captain calls out the cabin crew prepare for takeoff message and I start to let go of the tension that built up. FC, smiling: "Is this seat taken?" I can't help but laugh as she sits down. FC: "I'm so sorry about that, when I told them to ask you I didn't think this is what would happen. "I told her if was fine and we had a pretty nice chat during takeoff until she went back to do her job. She also gave me a free drink once service started so despite the annoying start it turned into a pretty nice flight.
First time starting off a thread, as I didn’t have enough karma before!Context: I live in the centre of a town that does a yearly half marathon. The marathon route basically traps me in my building as it goes on the roads around it, which I need to cross to reach the rest of town. It has been taking place years and was here before me, so I’m not bothered by it - I just avoid leaving my building until most the runners have gone.On this day I had an errand to run but was going out in the afternoon, so was forced to push through the crowds on the pavements to then wait and cross through the runners.I managed to get to the shops and do what I needed to do. On my way back, it started hailing a crazy amount - huge stones that made the ground look like it had been snowed on! Spectators were sheltering underneath shop awnings, including the one above the door to my building, where a mum and her two young children were standing.Cast: Me - mighty Elmo, EM - evil mutton Me: excuse me, sorry (so British), can I just quickly get through? EM: - looks absolutely furious - NO! Find your own spot, we’re standing here!Fair enough - the door isn’t too obvious Me: no, I actually just live in this building, so I just need to get through that doorEM: I don’t think so! These are offices, I work in them! Don’t try and fool me and my girls into moving for youThey are not offices so lord knows why she’d say that. She’s still in my way.Me: I really do live here, look, I have my key and can open this door!EM: no! Can you just piss off and go somewhere else? She’s being loud so EVERYONE nearby can hear and is staring. Me: look, I really do just want to get into my home. Everyone is looking at us now so if I am just trying to get you out the way I don’t think they’ll put up with it, do you?EM: fine! Remember, everyone is looking! She moves so I put my key in my door and, quelle surprise, it opens. I give EM a little wave as I walk through and clock a couple of onlookers stifling some laughter. After all that, EM immediately walks off with her two daughters, into the hail.TLDR: EM blocks my entry into my block of flats, looks like a fool when I successfully open my front door.EDITS: Wow this blew up overnight - thank you for the golds, you kind people!There's been a lot of comments about why she lied. My building genuinely does just look like a block of offices, so my guess is she was assuming I was lying to get away from the hail, and made a quick judgement (I look very young, have pink hair, piercings and tattoos) to decide her lie was more believable than mine.Pro-tip - if you can possibly avoid it (I know it's near impossible in busy cities), do not get an apartment in a business area of a town/city... people are dicks! This is the worst inconvenience, but we get so much staring and people looking into our foyer/lobby when we're unloading food shopping/moving big items/just leaving the building. It's annoying AF!Update 14/06 - there seems to be a few more people finding this thread, so I thought you might be interested to know there was another similar event, that blocked my building off in an even bigger way than last time! Fortunately no EP encounters that day though!
I'm currently a nanny for a family I've been with for about 6 months. They always pay me on time and I adore the little boy I'm taking care of so we've never really had any problems until now. I recently found out that I have ovairan cancer and need to have one of my ovaries removed. My conversation telling EP about my surgery went something like this-- EP: Did I not tell you about our family reunion? Me: You did, but unfortunately I won't be able to come and help becuase I'll have just had surgery. EP: You'll need to reschedule then. Me: I'm not going to do that. EP: We've had this planned for months, you need to be there to help. Me: I'm sorry but I won't be able to be there. EP: Are you kidding?Me: No. EP: I'm not sure how much I trust leaving my child with you if you don't care enough to be there for our family when we need you. Me: I care about him a lot and hope I have shown that over the last few months working for you. EP huffed and stomped off. I'll update when they're talking to me again.Update: Grandma just showed up and said EP called her to relieve me for the day and she'd like me to come early tomorrow to have a "family meeting".[Family meeting update](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/bbndhc/update_ep_inconvenienced_by_my_cancer_diagnosis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)
Well shit, I’m guessing you guys need background. My sister, well call her E, she got killed by a drunk driver about a month ago, and this really hurt not only because she’s my sister, but we were best friends. She always had my back and I had hers. She was 20 so she was just getting into the fun part of life, about to graduate college, everything was fucking great. So the funeral was hard at the start, I was a bearer which for those who don’t know, they help carry the casket. When the priest opened it up at first and let us look, that’s when I started crying, and I never stopped.Almost halfway through, I hear the doors slam open in the back. There’s this woman and 3 kids that walk in. The woman is talking (in reality is close to screaming) into her phone. Of course after 2 minutes the kids are running around and being loud. This is getting on everyone’s nerves so my mom asks the priest to get them out.The priest is a timid guy so of course, he couldn’t get himself to do it, so he pages someone from the looks of it. So while we wait for this family to get out, we have to stop. I was really pissed at this damn mom and I was about to murder her when my mom gets up and storms over to the bitch. She grabs her phone and slams it on the ground. The entitled bitch starts FREAKING OUT like her kid just died. She’s screaming at my mom, who is just standing there in rage. When the bitch is done, she starts screaming about how “YOU CLEARLY ARE IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO RUIN MY DAUGHTERS FUNERAL, THEN YOU CAN GET THE FUCK OUT, AND GET YOURSELF A NEW DAMN PHONE!” I was a mixture of shocked and impressed. Shocked cause I’ve never seen my mom that mad, not even in the hospital. Impressed cause she did nothing more physical then point a finger. I would’ve snapped her neck!The bitch of course defended herself, saying that how could she know it’s a funeral. Look around bitch, why is there a casket, tears, a priest. The fucking nerve on some people to do shit like that! She started mocking my mom, getting her things, and on the way out called us horrible people, for ruining her afternoon. This enraged me. I ran after her and after I screamed out to the “entitled bastard” I started screaming the following.“YOU FUCKING SLUT (idk why slut, I was just mad) YOUR AFTERNOON IS RUINED?!? OH NO, WHAT WILL WE DO??? WHAT WOULD WE DO WITHOUT THE POOR BASTARD HAVING A NICE AFTERNOON” She cuts me off and says,“Actually YOU people ruined my afternoon” This killed me, and I got the most mad I’ve ever been“YOU CAME HERE WITH YOUR DAMN KIDS AND RUINED MY FUCKING SISTER’S, KEEP IN FUCKING MIND IT’S NOT MY AUNT, ITS MY FUCKING SISTER, AND YOU FUCKING RUINED HER FUNEAL! SO YOUR DAY IS RUINED, (I mock cry) WELL GO HAVE YOUR DAMN PITY PARTY SOMEWHERE ELSE JACKASS!!”At this point I’m out of breath and I'm death staring her"Well, maybe if you weren't here in my space--"I couldn't take her anymore so I punch her in the gut. It wasn't too hard, not enough to really hurt her, but enough for her to feel it.  She of course screams Bloody Mary. I turn around and walk inside as she screams the usual, I’ve been assisted, call 911 bullshit. After that I never saw her again. She probably didn’t call the cops because she knew she was in the wrong. In the end, we finally got my sister buried and we lived on. I definitely miss her, and I’m so proud of myself for standing up in her name. Every once in a while, I stop in my her room and I have a one way conversation with her, and it’s comforting.This all was ridiculous I know, but I just can’t believe someone would have the guts to do that. Really slaughters my faith in humanity.Anyways thanks for reading this, hope you realized what absolute shitbags these people are.QUICK EDIT: Thank you guys for the support, It really means a lot to know that people still care. I really wish that I could respond to each comment but they all blew up at once, but know that im constantly reading them and loving ya'll! ^^
This is not my story, this is my girlfriend's story from school. Almost 10 years agoEp- entitled principal/parentK- principal's kidG- my gfS - gf's sisterMe and my gf were talking about traumatic events in our lives. I talked about my narcissist mother and my entitled extended family and after a couple of stories she told me this story. Back in 7th grade my gf was helping 4th and 5th graders after school with lessons homework etc... One of them was K, he apparently was a shy kid that was really smart but wouldn't speak at the blackboard so he had a ton of problems (after hearing this story I understand why he was so shy)Anyway in the month of may Gf's dad died because of leukemia and at  the end of may it was his funeral.G and S were destroyed by this and were discouraged from doing these private lessons after school.On Thursday 29th G and S told the principal that they wouldn't be coming on Friday because of the funeral. K was sitting at the computer in the same room. This is the conversation (not 100% because this happened back in 2008):G- Ep, we came to tell you that we can't come to school because of the funeral on Friday.Ep- That's okay. You woll still come to teach at the after school classes right?S- We can't, me and my sister will be where dad grew up to bury himEp- WHAT?! Then who will teach my son for his exams?!? (In Romania you have like a small exam every 2 grades until the 8th grade)S- your son is the smartest kid in his class. He doesn't need us, he's just shyEp- I DON'T CARE! YOU WON'T LEAVE SCHOOL ON FRIDAY OR I WILL KICK YOU OUT!In that moment G snapped.G- HOW ABOUT YOU SHUT UP AND LET US GO SEE OUR FATHER FOR THE LAST TIME BEFORE HE IS BURIED! YOU ARE THE REASON K IS SO SHY, YOU ARE CONTROLLING EVERY SINGLE MOVEMENT HE DOES!!G then began crying and breaking down while Ep was screaming back and S was defending G and that moment when K finally stood up against his mom.K- Mom let them go.. it's their last chance to see their father. You would do the same if it was your father!Ep was as red as a tomato but she calmed down and let them go on Friday.When G and S's mother heard what happened she was livid. On Monday when they came back apparently g's mom went to the principal's office and went crazy. Her mom went to the minister of education in Iași and managed to get Ep fired during summer and managed to make it so she couldn't get into education again.After school ended in june, they immediately moved to a private school the next school year. Hope you guys like this story even if it's not like the usual.
If this doesn't fit here please direct me to a more appropriate subreddit.Originally this was also posted in r/prorevenge and someone told me to share it here, the EP is named as A-hole.EDIT: SWEET BEJESUS MY FIRST REDDIT AWARD AND IT'S A PLATINUM also thank you for the silver and gold awards guysEDIT: r/prorevenge removed the original so I'm glad someone told me to post hereEDIT: A-hole is not my dad tooSome context: I was 11 when this happened and my mom was about 8ish months pregnant with my little brother, her live in boyfriend was a massive waste of DNA and usually took his frustration out on me but he thought I was at Mima’s (my grandmother) because my mom’s dietary changes while being pregnant were causing me health problems, I was over helping her with housework and had been playing games for about an hour at the time of the incident.So A-hole had gotten home at about 8 or 9 pm and he was already in a bad mood for some reason, my mom was going to see what was going on and asked him to stop shouting because last time the neighbors came over due to the noise volume and she didn’t want to have to explain that one again honestly, I didn’t blame her, she’s pregnant, her feet hurt, and she was in the hospital for kidney stones like 3 days before this happened so she’s tired and frustrated. Apparently A-hole decided he felt the need to be mad at her and started shouting obscenities at my mother, which led to me grabbing the baseball bat I kept under my bed and sneaking closer to hear.Well right as I got within range I saw his hand fly up and I had seen that gesture before, he was aiming to hit my pregnant mother so my first reaction was to swing that bat into his leg as hard as I could and when he went down I hit him maybe 3 or 4 more times at full force mind you, and even though I was a child I was certainly not weak and knew to aim for his knees (and wrist apparently, I nailed his left wrist at one point).My mother called Mima, and 911, which resulted in a cop car and an ambulance. The cops asked what happened as they loaded the man into the ambulance and he tried to say I assaulted him unprompted. This was when Mima came to the rescue and interjected that one; I have never hit someone without being hit first, and two; A-hole and my mom were constantly fighting, she then said they could ask the neighbors who verified the statement.When the cops then asked why I hit him so hard it broke at least one knee for sure I stated “He could hit me and I’d probably hide since he’s bigger than me, but he was going to hit my mom and she has a baby nearly here. I didn’t want the baby to get hurt so I hurt him first and made sure he wouldn’t do it again.” My mom agreed to press charges for assault, child endangerment, and child abuse (the cops were also informed of how he verbally, mentally, and emotionally abused me and Mima had at least one voice recording of this happening in the past).Now I didn’t go to the court cases because I was a child and everyone agreed to not bring in the children if it was avoidable, which it was since Mima had physical proof of his abuse, but later I found out he was only allowed weekend visitation at my mom’s convenience and had to pay child support, a few years afterwards he got himself arrested for some reason and had his visitation rights revoked by the court, so yeah, don’t attack my mom and don’t fuck with my little brother, my family will ruin you.NOTHING was more gratifying than knowing this man can no longer see his only child because he thought he could get away with being an abusive dick.
Cast:Me: some random dude in my house idk who that isM: my motherEM: my auntEK: most annoying kid in the universeTLDR at the bottomSome context/backstory: I still live in my parents house since my university is really close so I don't need to get myself an apartment. The story happened about a year ago. The story.On a beautiful Sunday morning, I got woken up by my mother telling me that she has invited my aunt with her kids for lunch. Now to be honest, I never liked that particular aunt that much but what can you do. So about 2 hours later, the family come over. We have our lunch and afterwards we sit around in the living room and chat about. At some point I notice from the corner of my eye one of my aunts kids (EK) going to my room. Now I had my computer open and I was a bit afraid that he might do something to it, so I followed him.Now that kid was about 8 at the time, and he should in no way be allowed to play violent video games, and me being an avid gamer, most (if not all of the games I had installed) were rated as PEGI 18 (meaning they were to be played by people over 18). The conversation went like this.EK: do you have any games?Me: I do but they are not for you, these are grown up games.EK: but I want to playyyyyMe: I'm sorry but you cannot.At this point the kid runs out of the room and to his mom.EK: OP does not let me play games.EM (to me) : come on let him play some games, he has nothing else to do.Me: the games that I have on my computer are not for his age, they are violent and disturbing at times.EM: but my little boy wants to play. Can't you let him play?Me: I'm sorry but these games are not for your childEM: EXCUSE ME? We are GUESTS and you have to do what we say. Just let him play! At this point, I've gotten really angry, and in hindsight, I should have just opened a flash games website and let him play, but this computer was my most prized possession, having built it myself with mostly my own money, and I would not let an 8 year old play freely with it cause I was afraid that he could damage it. Also, my malicious compliant side came out at that moment, so I did not pass the chance for some good old MC. I say ok to both mom and child and take the kid with me. I open Outlast (for those who don't know, Outlast is a horror game with many disturbing images and scary scenes, especially for an 8 year old child), and let him play. Not even 5 minutes in, I hear a scream from my room and I see EK run crying to his mother.EM: what the hell did you make him play?? What's wrong with you?Me: I told you before, my games are not for young children, they are for adults, but you wouldn't listenThe mom straight up picked up her children (one still crying) and left the house. After I told my mom what exactly I did, she burst out laughing.Learn to listen to people when they warn you.TLDR: entitle kid wanted to play games that are rated adult only and his mom forces me to let him, kid leaves with nightmares after playing said games.Edit: Huge formatting errors, and also thanks for internet points xdEdit no. 2: I just noticed that this post got a silver, and I've never gotten one so thank you kind stranger for the Internet currency :)Ps. I really don't get why people believe that everyone is lying here.. I know this is the Internet and you should not trust everything you see in it but for the love of God, just stop being stuck in that defensive mentality. Not everyone is a liar.
This didn't happen to me but to a friend of mine and the details will be written down as he told me the story.&#x200B;So long story short, my friend is a furry and at the time was attending Midwest Furfest.Now there are a TON of fun activities that attendees can partake in and most of the panels and activities listed on the official program are totally appropriate for families and kids. That being said, like any other type of geeky conventions, people will hold room parties in their hotel rooms or suites that are NOT part of the official program and are not the responsbility of the convention itself. Very often those room parties will either be gatherings of friends or sometimes they will just be centered around certain social groups. For example, there are Furries of Colour parties now and trans room parties. And sometimes , well, they will be parties of the more sexy kind. You know what I mean.&#x200B;Sometimes, to attract a certain crowd , especially at the social group parties, they will advertise the room party on a board near the hotel lobby to advertise the party's room number for those who might be interested to attend.&#x200B;Anyway, those parties are obviously PRIVATE functions and OBVIOUSLY the person who is paying for the suite/room has a complete liberty of choosing who is allowed inside and who is not. Especially if they are just a gathering between friends.&#x200B;Flash forward to Saturday evening. This is generally the biggest evening of the convention in terms of official events AND room parties. My friend is hosting a room party for gay men in his suite. The attendees are all legal adults, the majority of them in their late 20s early 30s. Nothing too risqué is going on, but it's a bunch of gay men together in a room, so "colourful discussions" and a bit of flirting and groping is happening from times to times (I mean , duh).&#x200B;At some point early in the evening, they hear a knock at the door.&#x200B;**Friend:** \*goes to the door and slightly opens it to see a kid, no older than 15 or 16 standing outside the door\***Friend:** "Ummmm, hi? Can I help you?**Kid:** "Can I come in?"**Friend:** "\*slight giggle\* uh, no. This is a private party. It's not part of the convention. Sorry"My friend then closes the door and returns to entertaining his guests.&#x200B;About 15 minutes later, another knock at the door.&#x200B;This time, my friend's roommate goes to answer the door and finds the same kid standing there, and this time he has his father with him.&#x200B;**Friend's roommie:** "Yes?"**Entitled Dad:** "Yes, my son came here earlier and was refused to be let in."**roomie:** "Well yes, but..."**Entitled Dad:** "Is there a specific reason why my son can't attend this event?"&#x200B;At this point my friend intervenes.&#x200B;**Friend:** "Sir, this is a room party, it's not part of the official program. Plus, your son is a minor and everybody here is a grown man in their 30s. This would be extremely inappropriate."**Entitled dad:** "Don't give me that! We paid full price for an attendance pass. I expect my son to be able to enjoy this convention to its fullest"**Friend:** "But.. that's what I'm telling you. This isn't covered by the convention ticket. This has nothing to do wi--"**Entitled Dad:** "But this party was advertised downstairs in the lobby!"**Friend:** "The board downstairs will advertise a lot of PRIVATE room parties, it's a convention thing. People will organise gatherings amongst friends and social groups because they're all gathered in the same spot for the weekend. That doesn't mean it has anything to do with the convention proper. Now please, can you leave? We've told you more than once that your son is not welcome here."My friend at this point hushes the ED and his kid out and closes the door.&#x200B;At this point, everybody thinks the story is over, but Entitled Parents being petty. It isn't.&#x200B;At around 11:30 PM, a much stronger knock is heard at the door. My friend goes to open the door and is met with hotel security and a Rosemont PD officer.**Friend:** "What the.. What is going on?"**Hotel Security**: "Sir, we've got a report of illegal activity taking place in this room, we'd just like to do a quick checkup."My friend is flabbergasted but lets the cop and security personnel in. Of course, they find absolutely nothing weird going on.**Friend:** "Can I at least know what this was about? This is very distressing."**Hotel Security:** "A man came to us earlier and said that your party guests were doing drugs and commiting acts of gross indecency by being sexually inappropriate where other people could see them."My friend then realizes it was more than likely ED and tells Hotel Security about how that ED tried to force the party attendees to let his minor son attend a room party full of grown adult males and how they had told them to leave repeatedly.Hotel Security apologizes and my friend got a partial refund on his room to make up for the intrusion and no more problems happen from then on. He doesn't know if anything happened to the man and his kid.
So summer of 2017 I worked as a lifeguard at the local waterpark, at the time I was 17 and thought that it would be fun to work there. There are lots of shitty things that have happened and lots of stupid people but this one has stuck with me the most. We had several waterslides and a hot tub which was particularly popular due to the weather averaging in the 70°s, we had several safety/rules signs posted around the hot tub stating things like " no more than 10 minutes at a time" "no more than 30 people in the tub" no children under age 6 in the tub" etc. The last one was often the cause of parents getting upset because their child was "freezing and just wanted to warm up" we would allow children 6 and under to sit on the edge and put their feet in the hot tub but due to the county health department rules we weren't allowed to let them be in the tub completely. Enter EP, it was early on a Friday morning just after open (so about 10:00) and there were maybe 6 families in the park, no wait times and no small children in the kiddie pool. This lady walks up to the hot tub and starts getting in, babe in arms ( I guessed by sight this child was 2 ish) I reminded the lady of the rule but that she could place her child on the edge with feet in the water if she liked.  Shortly after I look back over at the lady and not only was her child not on the side of the tub her child was completely submerged in the water (which was another rules, you couldn't put your head under) so I rush over to her and her child to check on the child and she quickly scooped her child out of the water and placed her on the side of the pool, all well within sight. I said to her " ma'am I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave the hot tub if I see you place your child in the water again"She snapped back at me " DONT call me ma'am I'm probably the same age as you! Anyways what's it to you it's my child and if I say it's okay then it's okay"I responded " I'm sorry but since I don't know your name that's what I though would be appropriate to call you, as much as I would like to let you decide what temperature water is okay for your child it's part of my job to enforce the rules, and that particular on isn't even created my my employer but rather the county health department."She scoffed then said "SURE it is" she rolled her eyes and walked towards the other side of the hot tub.Shortly after she got out of the hot tub walked up to one of my co-workers, asked something then went to the office to speak with my boss. A few minutes later my boss came to me and said "A lady just complained to me that you were rude to her? Want to tell me about what happened?" So I explained that I noticed that she wasn't following our rules and had brought her toddler into the hot tub regardless of my warnings. My boss was totally understanding and said "yeah that's what I though, she tried to tell me that you had called her kid a little shit and you called her fat, she said she wanted you fired and free tickets to the park. I told her I'd reprimand you and we'd look into what happened. I just came over here to make it look like I was giving you a talking to" 
EM blaming our tech department for a free to play game not working (PART 2)Now for those of you that need more context, part 1 is [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/azs6wl/em_blames_us_for_a_free_to_play_game_not_working/)But just in case - here is some context. We sold a new gaming computer to this Entitled Kid(EK) a few weeks ago. Custom built, based on what he wanted to use it for. 3 or so weeks prior to this the Entitled Mom (EM) came into the shop complaining that the computer was useless and 'broken' because it wouldn't play this specific game (It was Ghost recon online, it was during the early period of the release and was riddled with bugs - I managed to fix it then.)This brings me to this day. 3 weeks after the initial fix. Our shop had fluctuating foot traffic, some days we have no customers some days we have too many. it was the start of the new month, everyone had their salaries paid in. This means our shop was VERY busy, we barely had enough reps to deal with customers (we only had 3 people working on any given day).I was busy talking to a customer at the tech desk with a laptop that had a lot of issues. from mails not working to USB ports not working to even blue screens of death. In walks EM.. no EK no PC. I thought EM may have just been shopping around for new games or a keyboard or something for EK. EM walks up to the tech desk, to which i just quickly greeted with a "Hi [EM], ill be with you in a minute". EM stood there, arms crossed tapping her foot as if I was inconveniencing her by talking to a customer.About 5 minutes after I booked in the laptop, printed the necessary work orders, EM looked at me with this "FINALLY!" look. EM then proceeded to ask me "Uhm, ive been waiting for forever. Are you going to come pick up this computer from my car or not?!". I just looked on with a confused face. EM then told me she phoned the shop, my work colleague answered, and she said that she was on her way to drop of EKs computer, AGAIN. She had apparently been parked waiting, outside our shop, in the disabled parking spot for 15 minutes. To anyone that doesnt know, we have a disabled parking right by our front door. Previous post [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/az3twv/em_he_is_feeling_sorry_for_himself_and_his/)We we're so busy that my colleague afterwards had to apologize because we didnt have the time to look outside for a car to pickup a computer and he got too busy to inform me EM was on her way. (Customers did this often, but I do have a few more stories about stuff like this).So on to the computer, i went outside to fetch the machine. EM annoyed again asking why the game doesn't work. After a few minutes, and an EM 'trying' to explain what her son told her, I said I can figure it out and have a look at it. She then knew to ask what the labor cost would be due to the previous event. Knowing how stingy she is I told her no more than $20. she seemed fine with this "IF" it was the games fault again this time. (THIS time? please lady. the computer is working fine, i have the SAME issues with the game at home)After printing out papers she left. This is where the 'fun' begins... We couldn't access the account for some reason. I just remember having difficulty opening steam. At this point I just thought he forgot his details and we did the whole 'steam password reset' theme. After an hour of no results I write an email to steam support asking for help with the account.The next day steam wrote back with something along the lines of: "This steam account has violated the terms of service and is therefore banned" - it was a lengthy email detailing why the account got banned and that it cannot be retrieved. i was shocked at this email. EK tried to add cracked steam games to the steam library, There were no actual bought games in his library and I saw the icons on the desktop for a few games that cost well over $20, and bought aim hacking software for Ghost Recon online. Knowing now why the game "Wasn't working" I called EM to ask her and EK to come to the shop so I can explain to her why the game isnt working. This didn't seem like something I could say over the phone.I don't know exactly why his steam account itself was banned. Usually a VAC ban only affects the game you cheated in, but I think he may have even tried to crack steam to get games for free. I don't have a lot of experience with steam bans so forgive me for being a bit hazy on the details, this was around 5 years ago after all.A while later they both entered the store (as this was a Sunday, it was a lot quieter). I had printed out the response I got from steam - I told her that EK had been using illegal software, that he also bought with HER credit card without permission, and that steam has banned his account. I handed her the printed out mail so she could confirm that I wasn't lying or making any excuses. The look in EK's face was PRICELESS. At this point he knew he ROYALLY fucked up. He screwed da pooch. His face went white. EM turned over to him to ask what this was all about and he just nodded and said 'sorry'. She was LIVID - asking how he could just use her card without her permission. how could he buy illegal software.. how he could lie to her face about all of it. At this point EK was bawling his eyes out.This is where I started getting some respect for EM - she didn't even complain about the labor price. She in turn asked us to keep the PC in the shop for the whole week so EK could learn a lesson and clear it of all the illegal software. She was even fine with paying for the extra labor hours. (at the end we did a full new windows install as the cracks and hacks had tons of viruses included - so we spent a lot more time working on the computer)Unfortunately in the next story EM went back to being her entitled bitchy self again. Refusing to pay $35 for 2 days of full labor for 2 tablets, her home computer and EK's gaming rig.Edit: This blew up even more than part1 haha. Thanks to all of you for the support on this and my 2nd silver! ^^Edit2: We've nearly reached 10k upvotes! D: Well put a dress on me and call me Ma'am, I didnt see this coming haha!

 Repost from r/pettyrevenge because the original got removed for some reason.I like Pokémon. I also like Mc Donalds. So when Mc Donalds decided to release some Legendary Pokémon Happy Meal Toys, I WAS ECSTATIC.They offered two different Pokémon every week, so every Saturday, for about a month I would walk down to my local Mc Donalds and buy whatever Pokémon figure they had that week. I ended up with Latias, Latios, Groudon, Kyogre, Dialga and Palkia by the end of the month. Funny thing is, I only originally intended to buy Latias and Palkia because they were my favourite of the selection. I got Latias on day one, but I spent weeks trying to get a Palkia. I bought the rest of the figures each week as so not to waste a trip. And the employee started to recognise me. This is important.The next week is when my story happens. I walk into Mc Donalds and get into the queue. Ahead of me, a woman, let's call her Karen, oh wait, actually no. Let's NOT call her Karen. Pokémon has a character called Karen and she is really sweet and inspirational. Let's call this woman Debbie. Debbie is in a screaming fit at the poor cashier she's waving an unopened Dialga figure in his face. Apparently this Dialga is from a previous Happy Meal and she was trying to get it replaced, which is why she had it before she made her order.Debbie: WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER POKÉMONS?! (the plural of Pokémon is Pokémon, lady)Employee: We only have two this week. That one and the blue and white dragon (Latios, I'm assuming)Debbie: I DON'T WANT THIS RETARDED HORSE OR A DRAGON! GET ME A PINK ONE!Employee: We don't have-Debbie: YES YOU DO! I SAW A PINK ONE ON THE TV! SO YOU SHOULD HAVE IT! I WANT TO SEE A MANAGEREmployee, firmly: Look, ma'am. The manager would only say the same thing I've said. We only have two figures this week. The pink one that you're talking about is not here because we haven't ordered it in yet! If you want any of the other figures left over from last week-Debbie: I don't care! GO LOOK FOR ONE!Employee sighs and starts digging around in the basket. His eyes go wide for a moment as he pulls out a Palkia figure, looking as though he didn't expect it to be in the basket. Then he notices me behind Debbie and his face turns into an 'Uh Oh' face.Debbie notices that he's found a Palkia figure.Debbie: There! That wasn't so hard, was it?!He sighs and puts it into a Happy Meal box that Debbie ordered. Debbie smiles smugly and goes to sit down at her table, instead of grabbing the box and returning to her seat, she expects it to be delivered to her. Typical.Employee goes to take my order.Employee: I'm sorry, but that was the only Palkia we have. We haven't actually ordered more yet, so that one must have fallen in there by mistake during delivery.Me: That's fine... I'll just come in next week.Employee suddenly smiles as though he's thought of something.Employee: So you want a Chicken Nugget Happy Meal?Me: ????Employee grabs Debbie's Happy Meal Box from the counter and hands it to me.Me: Woah, what are you doing?Employee: I'll just say that you ordered the same thing and that I gave you the wrong box by 'mistake.'So I end up taking my Happy Meal box home (and the Palkia figure inside)&#x200B;TLDR: Employee is aware that I've come into Mc Donalds every week for a month looking for a Palkia Happy Meal Toy. Debbie is rude to him so he 'accidentally' gives me Debbie's Happy Meal and the Palkia inside it.&#x200B;Edit Edit: Everyone here is (rightfully) worried about what happened to Employee, so I went back to Me Donalds today to find out the aftermath. This is all I remember from a few hours ago when he told me, so the dialogue isn't 100% accurate.Apparently, Employee saw that Debbie had a young kid with her, so he fished out a Latias (the most girly/cute Pokémon) from the toy basket and put that in the box instead.After he delivered the box, Debbie IMMEDIATELY snatched the toy out of the box and was about to let loose a screaming session when she saw it wasn't Palkia. Debbie's kid saw the Latias and opened it immediately and looked really happy with it.Debbie's Kid: It's so cute!!!!!!!Debbie: WTF this isn't the pink one!Employee: I'm sorry ma'am, but someone else ordered the same meal and I gave them your box by accident. I tried to find another pink one and that's the closest I could get.Debbie looked like she wanted to huff again, but her kid was happy with the Latias anyway so Debbie couldn't say anything since she technically got the Pokémon that her daughter wanted.
Last year I gave haircuts just like my dad before his accident and a little fun fact, I am a male and pink is my favorite color so fuck that parent.                    *story is below*On this day the barber shop wasn't very busy. We had only gave cuts to about 4 people. The other barber went home after nobody came for an hour, which was irresponsible but I can't blame him. Then the next person walks. It's a woman with her son. The son looked about 14/15 and the mother looked like the 40 range. They walk in and I give the boy a haircut. At the end of the cut the boy ask for a little bit of pink dye in the front of his hair (the mom wasn't watching she was on her phone) so I did what he asked then we were finished and I told the woman the total and she looks at her son and saysEM: "What the hell is that? Why is pink in my sons hair?"Boy: "Mo-"EM: "What the fuck is you're problem. You aren't getting paid for ruining my sons hair." Me: "I'm sorry ma'am but-"Boy: "I asked for it."Entitled mom looks at the boy and you could tell that she was livid. I knew something was about to go down but I have to say I really appreciate that boy sticking up for me because I expected he'd say nothing and normally I don't know what to say in the situation so brownie points to him.EM: "WHY? PINK IS FOR GIRLS NOT BOYS!!"Entitled mom is shouting now. Basically is what I expected. I mean what else could she do?Boy: "YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SICK OF YOUR SHIT MOM. YOU LITERALLY DON'T RESPECT ANYTHING I DO! IF I HANG OUT WITH THE DISABLED AT SCHOOL YOU WILL FORCE ME TO HANG AROUND WITH THE PEOPLE WHO PICK ON THEM AND WHEN MY GIRLFRIEND BOUGHT ME A SHIRT WITH A PINK HEART ON IT YOU THROW IT IN THE GARBAGE. AND YOU ARE SO FUCKING LAZY. YOU MAKE ME AND DAD DO EVERYTHING AROUND THE HOUSE. FUCK YOU MOM!"The boy bolted out of the shop and the mother left to chase him. I didn't get my money but I wasn't really focused on that, I was focused on what the fuck just happened. The boy returned a few minutes later he came back and yeeted 20$ in the shop he didn't even step inside he opened the door and threw it. I think his crazy mom was chasing him still. I felt bad for the kid. I never saw them again and I don't work at the barbershop anymore.Holy shit, this post blew up! Thanks guys!also i'm on mobilea YouTuber named bumfris read my story holy moly.
