# password

## Date: 2017-05-16

This one's funny.

I somehow had the idea of locking a ton of scripts with a password.

Besides the obvious fact that password-locking code in open source programs without any form of encryption is *stupid*, somehow this is the first ever occurrence of any form of calculator script.

Making a calculator *now* is extremely easy, but I just haven't decided on *doing* one yet.
