# Realistic Pasting

## Date: 2019-12-03

I seriously don't know what this is supposed to have done, or why I decided to make it in the first place.

I fixed an error on line 93 and replaced the image paths with images of golden retrievers.

The resulting image had dark marks all over it. The program didn't do anything useful.
