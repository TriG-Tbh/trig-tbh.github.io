# Customizable Feed

## Date: 2019-09-17

A program that would select random posts from a subreddit (or multiple subreddits), compiles those posts into a single text object, and emails that to a specified email address.

In general, this worked. Were I to make this today, there would be a few specific things I'd change, but for now this is a working program.
