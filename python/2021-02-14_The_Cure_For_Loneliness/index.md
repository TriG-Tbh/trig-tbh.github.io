# The Cure For Loneliness

## Date: 2021-02-14

**I named this project the name it has right now because I was obsessed with a Jai Wolf album at the time it was created.**

This was really meant to be a bot that *only* I used.

I based it off of a character from a show I was watching, which can be seen in responses.json.

I think the most interesting part of this bot is that it had a blackjack engine that I created **from scratch** in the span of 6 hours.

Though the bot itself isn't all that interesting, the blackjack engine, with minor tweaking to remove the character parts, can be used to facilitate blackjack games *anywhere* (sockets, real games, etc.).
