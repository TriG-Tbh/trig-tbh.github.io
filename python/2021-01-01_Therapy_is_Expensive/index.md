# Therapy is Expensive

## Date: 2021-01-01

The idea was that the bot would have a ton of profiles based on fictional characters. 

It would also have an ELIZA chatbot, and tailor the chatbot responses to the specific character.

For example, a character that was more uptight and formal would have more formal responses and use proper punctuation. On the other end of the spectrum, a more carefree character would have informal responses and not use so much punctuation.

Though the original idea was never fully expanded upon, I think I could finish this one day with custom characters that aren't from any already existing work.
