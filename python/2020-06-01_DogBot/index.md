# DogBot

## Date: 2020-06-01

The original idea was to have a bot that could act as a dog.

The people using the bot would have to take the dog out for a walk, feed it, play with it, etc.

However, due to a corrupt filesystem, I lost all of the data for this bot and had to start over.

I salvaged what I could, but in the end just gave up all hope.
