# Vault 2

## Date: 2020-08-05

This version of Vault introduced an entirely new encryption system, and drastically overhauled the PIV.

This also included a journal program, which would take text and encrypt it into a file that can decrypted.

**The image display function of PIV in this version of Vault was not made by me.**

**This version of Vault was forked from improvements that another person made onto the original Vault program.**
