# scrabble_word_picker

## Date: 2021-03-15

Given a collection of letters, this program finds all of the words that can be created with those letters.

It also sorts them by how high their score would be in a game of Scrabble.

This was my original APCSP Create Task idea, and in fact was the original *program* that I was going to submit to the CollegeBoard.

Unfortunately, my teacher refused to grade the programs if they weren't written in JavaScript, and would score us lower if the files we submitted to the CollegeBoard did not match the files we submitted to him in class.

**Thanks**, Mr. B. *So* helpful.
