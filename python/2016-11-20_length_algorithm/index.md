# length_algorithm

## Date: 2016-11-20

A program based off of a game played by children.
One person would say a number, and another person would spell out that number. 
Using the length of that new number, they'd spell that out, and continue on and on and on until they get to 4.

Example: 10 => 3 => 5 => 4 = 4
