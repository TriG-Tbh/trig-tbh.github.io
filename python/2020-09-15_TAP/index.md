# TAP

## Date: 2020-09-15

Back in September of 2020, when we were all forced to do remote learning, my assignments were assigned on Microsoft Teams.

The funny thing about Teams during that time was that assignments were organized by class, and sorted in alphabetical order. If I wanted to look at my assignments to see what was due the soonest, I had to go through each individual class to see which assignment comes first.

Frustrated, I created a program that, in theory, would scrape the assignment data from Teams and upload it to a Notion page.

Unfortunately, this did not work. No matter what I tried, I could never consistently get the assignment data.

Eventually, Teams got updated to show all assignments, sorted by due date. Out of creating this program, I grew a distaste for Microsoft Azure and the Teams API.
