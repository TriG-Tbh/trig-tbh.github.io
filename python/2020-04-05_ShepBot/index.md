# ShepBot

## Date: 2020-04-05

This is the first bot that someone had asked me to do for them.

They were very much a dog person, and wanted a dog-themed bot.

While there's a lot of stuff that I'd change about this bot, it definitely became a monumental project for me (in terms of making programs that people actually want).
