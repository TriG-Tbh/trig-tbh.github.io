# Vault

## Date: 2020-04-23

There came a time where I wanted to be able to encrypt my own files.

The idea was to have them locked with a passcode, and the only way to read their contents was with that passcode. Thus, Vault was created.

Afterwards, I wanted to make a private image viewer. I believed that the Windows Photo Viewer app had some form of telemetry, and I wanted a way of privately viewing encrypted images. Through this, Private Image Viewer (PIV) was created.

This would be adapted over time, becoming more secure and more advanced.
