# alarm

## Date: 2017-03-22

A program that would play a video when a certain time was reached.

I'm 99% confident that **I** didn't create this, and that someone else did, specifically because of lines 11 and 50.

I didn't know what the os flags were, and I didn't know who aphex twin was.
