# HungerGames_recreation_betting_simulator

## Date: 2018-06-03

This one is hilarious.

It started with me wanting to recreate the already-popular [Hunger Games simulator](http://www.brantsteele.net/hungergames/), but in Python.

The idea was that I'd get a basic working model, and then slowly add to that.

I almost got it working, but it started adding random tributes where it shouldn't have.

Eventually, I added so much that I couldn't understand it. Even today, I don't know what half of it is supposed to do.

(Side note: everything was manually typed)
