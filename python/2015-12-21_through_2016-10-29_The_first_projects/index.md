# The first projects

## Date: 2015-12-21 (estimate) through 2016-10-29

These are all miscellaneous projects that I created when I first started using Python.
These projects spanned between the time span of almost a year.
The reason they do not have a specific date is that they were all recovered from a dying system.

When I was much younger, the Raspberry Pi that I used for coding mysteriously failed one day.
It would not boot, and the only thing that worked was the command line.
Files were being deleted, and I needed to salvage what I could.
So I grabbed a USB and copied as many files over as I could.
In doing so, the original creation dates of those files were lost.

One file that, unfortunately, didn't survive the transfer is a variable calculator.
This file was over 100 lines long, and operated as a calculator with multiple functions that also had the ability to store numbers as variables.

These files are the *first* that I created.
They mostly contain projects that were from a book that taught coding.
There isn't *too* much worth noting.
