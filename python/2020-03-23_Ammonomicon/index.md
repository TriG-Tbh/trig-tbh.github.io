# Ammonomicon

## Date: 2020-03-23

Back when I used to play Enter the Gungeon, I wanted a fast way of accessing item info.

Visiting the website was way too slow so I wanted a program that could get only the info I needed.

This never got finished, and I stopped playing the game a while after that.
